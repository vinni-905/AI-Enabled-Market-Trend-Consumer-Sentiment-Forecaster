Amazon,Networking_Devices,router,R2WQ8XV571CXWV,It works and is secure!,"I wanted a more secure WiFi router while also saving money on the rental from my cable provider, so I was suggested to purchase this by a very experienced tech and cyber security wiz. Now, I personally don't feel that I know much about anything technical these days, but I have really enjoyed this so far. Performance wise, but more than anything I REALLY love the security of the back-office type of controls the TP-Link gives you. PERFORMANCE Now, my current home is 1500 sq ft and a split level home, so most of the areas I use WiFi at home are never too far from the router. I placed the router right on the TV stand underneath the TV so that certainly is as close as it gets. When I'm upstairs (technically 1.5 levels up from the router) I still seem to get fine enough WiFi when I'm browsing on my phone. I will say that the WiFi randomly cuts out for me, but, this is definitely an issue I had with my previous equipment so I don't blame the router itself, it is my provider. Or the wiring outside my house.. not really sure. I have noticed however that when the service does go out, ever since changing to the TP-Link, the service returns much faster and I never have to reset it. With my old provider-provided router, it would be out for hours and I always seemed to have to manually reset the equipment. So in summary, the service and performance for me has been exemplary! SOFTWARE The primary reason I got this was to make sure nobody could hack into my WiFi. With other routers, I am not sure if the same service is available, but this was the first I've ever seen it. Yes... we all know that WiFi is password protected. BUT. Someone can easily hack into it, right? Well not with the TP-Link! You can access the router security through the routers IP address, and you set a password for that as well. The user interface is pretty simple for even a dolt like myself to understand. You can control who can access your WiFi by using a blacklist or a whitelist. A blacklist means that all who have the login details *except* for specific IP addresses you've blocked can access. A whitelist means that ONLY the IP addresses you have added to your list can access the WiFi. I am using the whitelist, since I do not want anyone random or unwanted accessing my service. Let me tell you, it works perfectly! Sometimes I forget that I have this setup, and I have tried many times with many different devices to try and access the wifi... heck, even the guest network, that I thought was specifically setup for this, doesn't seem to let random users access it. It also shows you who is currently accessing it, although I find that feature doesn't seem to be totally accurate sometimes. I give the software 5 stars for the simple fact that it is so easy to control access through it. SUMMARY Overall I am very happy with this purchase. It does what I want it to do, very securely. Setup was a little confusing because if I recall correctly, nobody could access it until we were able to get into the back-office software and setup password first. Other than that I really have had no issues and enjoy using it. When I need to change a setting it is super easy to get in and make any adjustments.",5,UAstudentn,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2022"
Amazon,Networking_Devices,router,R2L2PHG4W1FXBK,Reliable WiFi 6 performance with real improvements across the whole house.,"The TP-Link AX1800 WiFi 6 Router has been a noticeable upgrade in my home network, and everything here comes from my own experience using it in a fairly device-heavy household. I upgraded from an older WiFi 5 router that had started to struggle, and the improvement with the AX21 has been clear from day one. Setup was simple, but what I liked most was how much control the interface gives without feeling overwhelming. I used the browser setup and adjusted dual-band settings, enabled WPA3, and optimized the channel width in just a few minutes. The interface responds quickly, and making changes does not require constant rebooting or digging through hidden menus. The performance difference with WiFi 6 has been significant. I have multiple smart TVs, computers, phones, and IoT devices, and my previous router would slow down when several things were active at once. The AX21 handles everything smoothly. OFDMA and MU-MIMO keep the network stable even during heavy loads. I’ve streamed 4K content, joined online meetings, and transferred large files all at the same time without interruptions. Coverage has also improved. I tested it with the WiFi Analyzer app for Android, which I’ve used for years to check signal strength and network congestion. In areas where the old router consistently dipped, the AX21 delivered noticeably stronger and more stable readings. In actual use, this translates to fewer drops, steadier speeds, and better performance when moving between rooms. Beamforming makes a difference, especially with mobile devices. The wired connections are equally reliable. I connected my desktop and game console using the gigabit Ethernet ports and ran sustained transfers from a NAS. Speeds stayed at full gigabit with no fluctuations, and the router stayed cool throughout heavy use. Another thing I appreciate is how quietly and efficiently the router runs. It doesn’t heat up, even when multiple devices are streaming and downloading simultaneously, which says a lot about its hardware design. Based on my experience, the TP-Link AX1800 WiFi 6 Router offers a great balance of real-world performance, strong coverage, and easy configuration. It provides the benefits of WiFi 6 without the overwhelming complexity some high-end models add. For anyone looking for a reliable and technically capable upgrade, this router has been a very solid choice in my home.",5,Kambuko,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2025"
Amazon,Networking_Devices,router,R2SYE1J3KXB7AD,Tp-Link AXE5400,"I really regret not buying this TP-Link AXE5400 Wi-Fi 6E router earlier. The router from my internet provider only had two bands and a limited number of connected devices, which constantly caused issues. After switching to this router, those problems are completely gone. Now all my devices — and I have a lot of them — work perfectly stable with no random disconnects. I really love the tri-band setup. Smart home devices like cameras and robot vacuums run on the 2.4 GHz band, TVs, PlayStation, and gaming consoles use 5 GHz, and phones and laptops connect to the ultra-fast 6 GHz band. Everything is perfectly balanced and smooth. Setup was fast and easy, coverage is excellent throughout the house, and speeds are impressive on every band. Streaming, gaming, and working online all happen at the same time with zero lag or interruptions. This router has completely upgraded my home network. It’s powerful, reliable, and absolutely worth it. Highly recommended if you are tired of limitations from basic provider routers and want true Wi-Fi performance.",5,Fredsaw,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2025"
Amazon,Networking_Devices,router,R2PGHWQ5CH9KT0,Impressive Home Router,"I needed to replace my aging Netgear Nighthawk router, which didn't provide a great Wi-Fi signal at the outer limits of my home and was no longer eligible to receive firmware updates. After purchasing another a Netgear Mesh router system (and having nothing but constant connectivity issues), I returned that one. I did more research and ended up getting the TP-Link AXE5400. I had the best luck setting it up using the PC/Ethernet connection vs. the Tether phone APP that gave me trouble. The Admin via PC worked slick and I was quickly able to set up my network name & password and automatic firmware upgrades quickly. The router has been in-service for a week with no connectivity issues and great coverage throughout the house and out in the garage (where I couldn't get Wi-Fi with my old router). I can see why this was a PC Mag Editor's choice as this router has performed flawlessly. It's nice to know that this router is ready to add a TP-Link range extender, but with such a strong signal, I doubt I'll ever need it. Way to go TP-Link!",5,Lee B.,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2025"
Amazon,Networking_Devices,router,R9Y2I4ZDQ9Y8K,Love it! Love it!🥰,"We have lived in my house for over 10 years. It’s an older house built in the 60s, There are 6 of us in the house 4 adults, one 13y and one 7y. We have 3 ring devices, 4 Alexa’s, 6 fire sticks, 6 computers, 6 gaming consoles, a generator, and we all have iPads, cell phones etc, so there are a lot of devices connected to our wifi, so we’ve never had great luck with the range or performance of our internet signal. Things would buffer alot or we’d have dropped signals, so I was always restarting the router. We use to have Brighthouse but currently have Spectrum with just internet, We upgraded our internet to 1GB over a year ago and was given a dual band wifi 5 router that never really worked for us perfectly, I believe it was because it couldn’t support 1GB, but didn’t know that until I got this router. We were using an extender so we could connect to our generator and ring camera that was located outside, and just so you can have an idea, on our generator the wifi signal was at 2%, which was fine but if we wanted to connect anything else outside it was almost impossible. So we contacted customer support about the issues we were having, and they sent us there newest router the wifi 6e router, mind you we were still using the extender. It worked good for a couple days then it stopped. A lot of buffering and a lot of devices wouldn’t even connect to it like my Oculus Quest 2, my husbands work computer and more! I couldn’t even connect our ring camera outback, and the generator outside was getting 0%-1% signal, so the signal would drop a lot. I figured it was because a lot of things still aren’t compatible with wifi 6. So we called support again they did manage to get everything working for about 5 days, then it would stop again. So we called support for the last time and they told us to try to buy a router ourselves. So I happened to come across this one. I was pretty skeptical, thinking it may work as well as the dual band one we had only maybe a little better. The setup process was so easy! Didn’t have to call Spectrum at all! I do wish that the parental controls, security+ and, QoS was free. But they do give you a free month with any of them. So I did the security+. The app you use with it is great! There are a lot of tools in the settings. You can have it auto connect to a network or set it up separately so you can choose 2.4, 5 or 6G, which is what I did. You can have a guest network, optimize your network performance and a lot more! Everything connected perfectly with excellent signal! So I figured I would try to connect the generator and ring camera outback without the extender just for kicks, since I was feeling optimistic😎 The ring camera connected perfectly with excellent signal! Now was the most important test, the generator😵‍💫 Connected it for the first time and I see 22% signal!!! I was SOOO excited! Then I went to the farthest part of my backyard with my cell phone where Iv never had wifi signal before and I had 3-4 bars of wifi signal!!! I couldn’t believe it! This thing has GREAT range, GREAT performance, and is easy to set up and use, what else could you want! It’s been a couple weeks now, no buffering! and everything works flawlessly! I couldn’t be happier! No one complaining for me to fix the wifi anymore and no restarting it twice a week! I would definitely recommend this to anyone that has horrible or just ok wifi signal. The only flaw I can say about it is needing a subscription for the extras. Otherwise just go for it! You don’t like it just return it.",5,Fran,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2023"
Amazon,Networking_Devices,router,R212GSPJGDJEDT,Works great,"I've never used a router before, so I was honestly a little overwhelmed by all the parts and pieces that come with this. It looked like there was a lot to learn. But after reading through the manual and finding a random 5-minute YouTube video on how to use a router, I got the basics and went ahead and tried it out. And? I think it's great! I was doing tests on a nasty old 2x4, so don't judge the prettiness (or lack thereof) of the work in my photos. Considering it was my first time ever using a router, though, I'm impressed with how well it worked out (and how cleanly it cut). I tried out the round-over bit, going deep to round the edge while leaving a shoulder. And I tried one of the straight bits to plunge in and cut a straight groove. I found the router to be powerful, simple to handle and overall easier to use than I expected. You just pop in your bit, use the 2 wrenches to tighten the collet, adjust your depth and you're good to go (or add the guide first for more precision). My only nitpick is that I think the straight guide could be better. The screw and wing nut that you use to set your distance isn't all the great. But at this price, I'm not complaining. I think it's a bargain.",5,Trixie,FALSE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2025"
Amazon,Networking_Devices,router,R12GO0K22ZO8HN,Nice fixed base budge palm router kit,"This palm router is better quality than I expected and comes with guides and 6 common router bits making it essentially a ready to use kit. The router bits appear to be more budge quality than higher end bits, but they should work fine for casual use but likely will dull quickly. I unfortunately injured myself so I cannot give them much testing at this time. The bits do come with plastic storage containers that are great for protecting the bit blades from being damaged in storage and will be useful for future replacement bits. There are some features missing that more expensive palm routers will have like variable speed and soft start. Being at full speed, make sure any bits you purchase are rated for at least 35000 rpm. The motor feels like it has plenty of power to handle harder woods or even moderate size bits. This is a fixed depth with the depth adjustment having a metal gear that rides along molded teeth in the plastic body of the router. This may wear faster than if it was metal on metal, but with extra care it shouldn’t be a real issue anytime soon. This router will come in handy for those uses where getting out my full size router is too much work or when it’s on my router table. Overall for a casual DIYer or someone just starting to build their shop this is a great value that I hope will last for a long time. Due to an injury I haven’t been able to test this much, in a couple months I will put this through its paces and will update my review as needed.",4,Seth,FALSE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2025"
Amazon,Networking_Devices,router,R3QCJSKS9WB1W7,Excellent Value and Performance for Woodworking,"This compact router tool is an absolute steal for the price. The 630W, 5.3 Amp motor offers plenty of power for small-to-medium woodworking tasks, and the 35,000 RPM speed makes for a very clean, smooth cut. The fixed base is solid and easy to adjust. I especially appreciated that it came with both the 1/4"" collet and a good starter set of 5 trim bits, meaning I could use it right out of the box. The inclusion of the straight and roller guides, along with the extra wrenches and carbon brushes, shows a commitment to providing a complete kit. It's comfortable to handle and a great choice for both beginners and hobbyists looking for a reliable, compact trim router.",5,Amazon Customer,FALSE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2025"
Amazon,Networking_Devices,router,R3NMPN9IOAZB3H,"Works well, fits my DIY CNC router mounting bracket nicely","This router works fairly well. The motor runs fine, though a bit loud (it is a router after all). The various brackets for straight edge and circle routing seem to work fine though they aren't the sturdiest I've seen they did ok when I tried them out. The best thing for me is that it fits the bracket for my DIY CNC router so I can use it to replace the 24V cordless trim router I was using (though I ran it via a power supply rather than using batteries). The depth of cut adjustments are fairly intuitive if you've ever used such a router before, it's fairly easy to adjust the height. The included bits are sharp and cut decently. All in all this is a fairly decent trim router and I'm satisfied with it.",4,Mark Massingill,FALSE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2025"
Amazon,Networking_Devices,router,R3CZJ75EQFXY9A,Ease of Installation for those that are clueless to network connectivity.,"25 years ago, I installed server systems, terminals, printers, and network routers. All that networking equipment had to be set up with laptops directly connected to the routers' ports. Nothing was autosensing. I enjoyed it, but I knew what I was doing. Fast forward to today. I had to replace my own 25-year-old router because new laptops would not connect to it due to upgraded security software. I thought, Oh boy. I bet this is going to be a trip. I had forgotten most of what I knew; besides, I knew nothing about this new stuff. I picked this TP-Link AC1200. It was inexpensive, but we didn't need anything robust since we are not gamers. First of all, I ordered it on Amazon at about 3 pm. 8:30 pm, a car backs into my driveway. They delivered the router in less than 6 hours. Incredible! Today I went to install it. I was expecting a bit of a hassle with configuring this thing. After physically connecting the two cables —the power cord and the network cable —I powered it on. I went to my PC. The TP-Link showed up in my available networks. I click on it. Put in the password supplied. Got connected, but I had no internet connectivity. Ahh! I had to disconnect a cable from my MAIN in-house router, then reconnect it so that the router ID would be discovered. I went back out to the shop, clicked on Safari (I have an Apple MacBook). Wala, I'm IN. I could NOT believe how easy the installation went. No glitches, smooth operation, and my network is all updated. I know how networking operates, but I am clueless about all the newer equipment since I've been out of the field for almost 15 years. So, even a stupid person like me can set up this equipment that used to take a lot of training 25 years ago. This inexpensive wireless router is absolutely outstanding. I usually do not write such long reviews, but I could not let this pass without adding my thoughts about the TP-Link AC1200 WiFi Router. I'm so glad these routers were not around when I was in the field. If they had been, my great-paying job would not have existed. Now that I am retired, I'm happy for them, so I can still dabble on the Internet.",5,foxron,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2025"

I saw many recommendations not to use both of them as routers, but did and it works perfectly. The coverage is excellent and fit nicely on top of a bookshelf along with the T-Mobile router. I love the ability to separate out my smart devices into a network dedicated solely to them, which the TP-Link is easily setup to do.

Amazon,Networking_Devices,router,R2B72PQ2E5WW6O,Great for Spectrum 200mbps plan!,"Update: It is now April 21, 2020 and we've been using the router for 2 months. It is still working perfectly for us and we have zero complaints. I highly recommend it! We moved to the middle of nowhere about 7 years ago and it never occurred to us to check who provided TV/internet/phone at the new house before buying. We found out after buying the house that the only providers were satellite companies. We realized very quickly that first year that satellite sucks, the internet specifically. We got locked into a $75 a month plan with HughesNet for a year and never once were able to actually use the internet that whole year. It was really frustrating. We simply did not have home internet for the past 6 years due to a lack of a decent provider. This past week Spectrum finally moved their service to our road. We immediately signed up. I knew I wasn't paying them $5 a month to rent a router from them but I also wasn't sure at all how to pick out a router myself. I've always been pretty tech savvy but when you lose access(and a need) to those things you stop keeping up with them, I was seriously behind on all the new updates that have been made over the last several years. I knew I didn't want to spend more than $50 on a router and after doing some research I finally decided on this TP-Link AC1200 and basically just hoped for the best. Some of the reviews weren't great so I was nervous. It arrived a day after our internet was installed so I set it up by myself. It took me all of 20 mins from unboxing to the whole house having Wi-Fi, it was VERY easy. I love that it has it's own app, a very convenient feature. We live in a 2000sq. ft., one floor, manufactured home. These homes have pretty thin walls so the signal reaches from one end to the other very easily. We are also extremely heavy on our data usage in this family and while it's only been a couple of days now it has had zero trouble keeping up with us. We've had zero buffering while streaming & using our phones, everything has been working very quickly. We have several smart TVs, cell phones, a laptop, a printer & a PS4 connected to it at the moment. The technician from Spectrum who installed our internet also said this was a good option for our 200mbps plan. I hope this helps someone make up their mind on whether this router will be a good choice for them. I will update the review if anything changes but as of now this seems to have been a pretty solid purchase and I'm happy with it.",5,Jennifer,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2020"

Amazon,Networking_Devices,wifi modem,RHB3F7JTR825R,Best 2in1 wifi modem,"CAX Modem Review: Reliable Performance and Impressive Speed and save on ISP rental fees As an avid internet user who relies heavily on a stable connection for both gaming and entertainment, I recently decided to upgrade my modem and went with the CAX modem. After using it for a few months, here’s my take on this device. Design and Setup: The CAX modem has a sleek, modern design that fits well in my home office setup. It's compact, which is great for saving space, and the LED indicators are clear and intuitive, giving you an immediate status update on your connection. The setup process was surprisingly easy; I followed the instructions included in the box, and I was online within 20 minutes. The modem is compatible with most major ISPs, making it a versatile choice for different users. Performance: Where the CAX modem truly shines is in its performance. With my previous modem, I often encountered buffering issues and dropped connections during high usage times and packet loss. However, since switching to the CAX, I’ve experienced significantly faster speeds, particularly when streaming 4K content or gaming online. The modem supports DOCSIS 3.1, which allows for lightning-fast download speeds, and I can confidently say it lives up to its promises. Connectivity: The CAX modem features multiple Ethernet ports, which is a fantastic addition for anyone with multiple wired devices. The Wi-Fi range is impressive as well; I’ve noticed a stable connection even in rooms that previously had weak signals. This feature has been extremely beneficial for my family, enabling seamless browsing and streaming on multiple devices without any lag. Value for Money: With its robust performance and modern features, the CAX modem is reasonably priced, especially considering the cost savings on rental fees from ISPs. If you’re a heavy internet user, investing in a quality modem like this can lead to significant long-term savings. Conclusion: Overall, the CAX modem has exceeded my expectations. Its design is user-friendly, setup is a breeze, and its performance is flawless. For anyone looking to enhance their home network experience, the CAX modem is certainly worth considering.",5,Peter H,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2025"

Unfortunately, this CAX30 is already a few years old, so I won't be getting updates for more than a couple more years. But I think that will be okay if I keep the Armor security plan.

Amazon,Networking_Devices,wifi modem,R1GU88Y83CJSLZ,Simple setup with Netgear app/Strong coverage,"Bought this NETGEAR Nighthawk to avoid paying Spectrum for a router. If you're a Spectrum customer, this router works with the Spectrum modem. It arrived this morning and after 20 minutes it's up and running. We live in a one floor, 1500 square foot condo. Coverage is excellent throughout on 10 devices. The router is also small and fits nicely on our bedroom dresser. What I'm most impressed with is the setup and NETGEAR app. Download the NETGEAR app to your phone using a QR code provided on the instruction sheet. After establishing a NETGEAR account follow the prompts. This initial setup tutorial is fairly boiler plate, what sets this app apart is how it responds to issues. For example, if your router fails to connect on the first attempt, as mine did, it tells you precisely which settings to change on your phone to correct the issue. And these settings changes solved the problem in all three cases that occurred during my set up. I've never experienced this level of intuitive app support. I won't pretend to offer any review of the technical capabilities of the router, definitely outside my bandwidth, but if you're like me, comfortable with using technology, but needing guidance to navigate setups, this is a great product. The phone app is also easy to navigate and relatively self explanatory. To demonstrate, I ran a speed test from the phone app. It's way easier than using the settings function on your device. Download speed is 113.72 Mbps, Upload is 12.07 Mbps and Ping is 15.0 Ms. Do I fully understand what these mean, no, but with a small amount of research I could if issues arise. Bottom line, I'm so happy this product was easy to setup and am very pleased with the value. For a few months rental cost on my Spectrum Router, I avoid paying a lifetime monthly fee. I will leave it to others to debate the merits of the technical functions of this router.

Amazon,Networking_Devices,wifi modem,R2J7QAYEHB1IAT,Not working - factory reset made it worse,"I bought this router as a recommendation of my ISP for our city's new Fiber. It is rated over 1 GB, which is what I'm getting from the city's link. I have an ISP who I highly recommend, and they helped me troubleshoot it as far as they could, and the result is, the fiber is up (I tested it by removing the router from the network and plugging my laptop directly into the city/ISP's device, and everything popped back to life.) The jury is not still out on this one. I can't recommend it to anyone. I go back to work tomorrow, and don't have internet in my home office. Neither does my wife. I'll have to run to Best Buy (Worst Experience Ever), or Walmart (they know nothing about anything), and pick something up that WILL work. I don't trust the things Amazon has been doing, so am not sure that I'll get anything back on this purchase. That's just under $100.oo wasted for a product that lasted almost exactly 6 weeks. I used to trust Netgear. It's been a while since I bought anything of theirs. Not since I stopped being an I.T. Director and don't need to purchase equipment for a company. But, my customers now are places everyone's heard of, like Vanderbilt U., the U.S. Senate, the House or Reps; Apple, Oracle, Facebook. You know, tiny companies... I'm not a happy camper. It's Sunday late, and nothing's open, and it sucks to be me. Oh wait, Walmart is open, and I got a TP Link Wi-Fi 6 router. It works fine, as long as I have Smart Connect turned on. With that off, the link is flaky. I tried that with the Netgear router, but it made very little difference. So, to date (it's been several days since writing the above), I was told by Amazon that I had to go to Netgear for help. They will require going through the standard troubleshooting steps, so I'll have to take my internet down and plug this thing back in, then a Netgear engineer will access the router and check stuff out... I may get a new one out of this, and I'll be okay with that. No such luck. I reset it and it stayed up a couple of weeks, but now is completely dead. I'm never buying Netgear again.

Amazon,Networking_Devices,wifi modem,R2WQ8XV571CXWV,It works and is secure!,"I wanted a more secure WiFi router while also saving money on the rental from my cable provider, so I was suggested to purchase this by a very experienced tech and cyber security wiz. Now, I personally don't feel that I know much about anything technical these days, but I have really enjoyed this so far. Performance wise, but more than anything I REALLY love the security of the back-office type of controls the TP-Link gives you. PERFORMANCE Now, my current home is 1500 sq ft and a split level home, so most of the areas I use WiFi at home are never too far from the router. I placed the router right on the TV stand underneath the TV so that certainly is as close as it gets. When I'm upstairs (technically 1.5 levels up from the router) I still seem to get fine enough WiFi when I'm browsing on my phone. I will say that the WiFi randomly cuts out for me, but, this is definitely an issue I had with my previous equipment so I don't blame the router itself, it is my provider. Or the wiring outside my house.. not really sure. I have noticed however that when the service does go out, ever since changing to the TP-Link, the service returns much faster and I never have to reset it. With my old provider-provided router, it would be out for hours and I always seemed to have to manually reset the equipment. So in summary, the service and performance for me has been exemplary! SOFTWARE The primary reason I got this was to make sure nobody could hack into my WiFi. With other routers, I am not sure if the same service is available, but this was the first I've ever seen it. Yes... we all know that WiFi is password protected. BUT. Someone can easily hack into it, right? Well not with the TP-Link! You can access the router security through the routers IP address, and you set a password for that as well. The user interface is pretty simple for even a dolt like myself to understand. You can control who can access your WiFi by using a blacklist or a whitelist. A blacklist means that all who have the login details *except* for specific IP addresses you've blocked can access. A whitelist means that ONLY the IP addresses you have added to your list can access the WiFi. I am using the whitelist, since I do not want anyone random or unwanted accessing my service. Let me tell you, it works perfectly! Sometimes I forget that I have this setup, and I have tried many times with many different devices to try and access the wifi... heck, even the guest network, that I thought was specifically setup for this, doesn't seem to let random users access it. It also shows you who is currently accessing it, although I find that feature doesn't seem to be totally accurate sometimes. I give the software 5 stars for the simple fact that it is so easy to control access through it. SUMMARY Overall I am very happy with this purchase. It does what I want it to do, very securely. Setup was a little confusing because if I recall correctly, nobody could access it until we were able to get into the back-office software and setup password first. Other than that I really have had no issues and enjoy using it. When I need to change a setting it is super easy to get in and make any adjustments.",5,UAstudentn,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2022"
Amazon,Networking_Devices,wifi modem,R2L2PHG4W1FXBK,Reliable WiFi 6 performance with real improvements across the whole house.,"The TP-Link AX1800 WiFi 6 Router has been a noticeable upgrade in my home network, and everything here comes from my own experience using it in a fairly device-heavy household. I upgraded from an older WiFi 5 router that had started to struggle, and the improvement with the AX21 has been clear from day one. Setup was simple, but what I liked most was how much control the interface gives without feeling overwhelming. I used the browser setup and adjusted dual-band settings, enabled WPA3, and optimized the channel width in just a few minutes. The interface responds quickly, and making changes does not require constant rebooting or digging through hidden menus. The performance difference with WiFi 6 has been significant. I have multiple smart TVs, computers, phones, and IoT devices, and my previous router would slow down when several things were active at once. The AX21 handles everything smoothly. OFDMA and MU-MIMO keep the network stable even during heavy loads. I’ve streamed 4K content, joined online meetings, and transferred large files all at the same time without interruptions. Coverage has also improved. I tested it with the WiFi Analyzer app for Android, which I’ve used for years to check signal strength and network congestion. In areas where the old router consistently dipped, the AX21 delivered noticeably stronger and more stable readings. In actual use, this translates to fewer drops, steadier speeds, and better performance when moving between rooms. Beamforming makes a difference, especially with mobile devices. The wired connections are equally reliable. I connected my desktop and game console using the gigabit Ethernet ports and ran sustained transfers from a NAS. Speeds stayed at full gigabit with no fluctuations, and the router stayed cool throughout heavy use. Another thing I appreciate is how quietly and efficiently the router runs. It doesn’t heat up, even when multiple devices are streaming and downloading simultaneously, which says a lot about its hardware design. Based on my experience, the TP-Link AX1800 WiFi 6 Router offers a great balance of real-world performance, strong coverage, and easy configuration. It provides the benefits of WiFi 6 without the overwhelming complexity some high-end models add. For anyone looking for a reliable and technically capable upgrade, this router has been a very solid choice in my home.",5,Kambuko,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2025"
Amazon,Networking_Devices,wifi modem,R2ZP9M7J9RKUSF,Worked great for 58 days - then it didn't - Thanks Comcast,"UPDATE 3 ************** You can read my sad tale below if you choose. But a quick summary may suffice. I got the SB8200 and it worked for 58 days. It then stopped working. It was replaced by Arris but the second modem did not work, either. That modem was replaced by Arris and the third modem did not work. The odds of getting three bad modems were pretty near zero so attention turned to Comcast. A tech came out and confirmed that the SNR was way low and the signal levels were out of bounds. He ran a new cable to the Comcast distribution box and installed a new splitter. The third modem connected immediately and worked perfectly. The fact that my old modem (not a docsis 3.1) worked had initially suggested that the problem was the new modem instead of the Comcast line. Arris support was GREAT through all this. I got right through to a live tech after about 3-5 rings (after their voice menu system answered and directed my call). They replaced the modems quickly (I had to send old modem back via ground - free return shipping - but they sent replacement modem via next day delivery). This is some of the best support of any company I deal with. It is pretty much the opposite of Comcast where getting to a live agent can be very difficult. This review was originally a 2 star but is now a 5 star - and I would give Arris support 6 stars if I could. ORIGINAL POST ********************* I have had this modem for 58 days. It was working well connected to Xfinity. Good download speed. Then, today it became intermittent. It ran for a couple of minutes, then lost internet connection, then was back but at slower download speed. Then it was running fine. That pattern continued to repeat. I had hoped it was an Xfinity issue, but I reconnected my previous modem and everything is working just fine. Before purchase I had read the bad reviews, but there were way more good reviews so I hoped that I would be one of those customers that got a ""good one"". Nope. Besides EVERY modem I looked at had about the same number of bad reviews. Many saying - don't buy this. So what is one to do? UPDATE ************** I contacted Arris customer support. I got through to a tech IMMEDIATELY. He said they needed to check the modem while it was online. Since I had already installed by backup modem, I had to contact Comcast and switch my MAC address back to the Arris and get in connected. I then called Arris back and again was connected to a tech, immediately. The reason this is a 2 star rather than a 1 star is because of the ease of contacting support. The tech looked at the modem stats and agreed it was bad. After a 5 minute delay while he consulted with a supervisor, he approved my return of the modem. He emailed me a prepaid shipping label and said they would send a new modem to me as soon as they received the old one back. So what Arris may lack in quality, they do mostly make up for in good customer support. Realistically, any product can fail, so the experience in dealing with a failed product is an important part of the buying process. Arris support gets 4 stars from me - one star off for making me reinstall the modem so they can verify it was bad. Though that was a perfectly reasonable request from them, I had pretty good evidence of my assertion that it was their modem which was the issue. Update 2 ********** I got the replacement modem. I spent about 90 minutes on the phone with Xfinity and Arris customer support trying to get that modem working with Xfinity. We could not get the modem to work - it seemed like it was working for a few seconds here and there. So I am sending this replacement back and will get yet another replacement (for the replacement).

It is very easy to hook up, with a power cord, incoming comm cable, and then whatever you decide to add for direct connections. The automation within this hardware is the most advanced that we've experienced. This will auto reset, and do a number of different steps (many which are beyond my comprehension) to ensure the connection is solid and to maintain accessibility. In testing the other wifi signals in our area, there is no interference or competing signals at the WiFi 7 range. Even for the lower ranges, the G54 is excellent about placing our signal in low use channel. All that to say, I've enjoyed this device for the last several months, and now feel like it was worth the cost since we've had excellent coverage ever since the initial connection was established (and sorted out with our provider).",5,S.

Amazon,Networking_Devices,wifi modem,R34K2YCUDJ5IE5,"STAY FAR FAR AWAY, Worked marginally for about 6 months then exhibited a number of defects","BUYER BEWARE: This product being a DOCSIS 3.1 Modem seemed to be safe and solid when I purchased last year on Amazon.com. Little did I know that problems would gradually start to increase with the Arris Surfboard SB8200, and seems to be an unfortunate pattern I have found with Arris Brand Cable Modems and Gateways. Customer Support is lacking and avoids addressing the issue while frequently diverting from the main problem they are asked to assist with. Arris brand products I have experienced continue to demonstrate noticeable defects and appear to be made with poor quality parts. I have purchased the Arris SB8200, SGB8300, SB6190 and SB6183 Cable Modems and Gateways and this is particularly if you have Cox Communications for an ISP, it is wise to reconsider this brand if you want a reliable internet connection and service. I strongly suggest you steer clear from this brand! The SBG8300, SB6183 and SB6190 all exhibited problems from the start, but this Surfboard SB8200 was particularly deceiving, since on the surface it seems that it would be a top performing product being DOCSIS 3.1 and not made with the Puma 6 Chipset some of us had the misfortune of experiencing defects with. I have now found this SB8200 device to be useless after 6 months and hours and hours troubleshooting with Arris customer support via chat, phone and email. You will be out of options when this product starts to fail, which for me is outside the return time frame with Amazon and Arris will refuse to take any type of accountability or responsibility for this failing product. The numbers of issues faced with this defective product has been extremely frustrating and caution a prospective buyer of this DOCSIS 3.1 modem to reconsider. Do yourself a favor, choose another brand Modem or Gateway. Anything with this brand made within the last 5 years I have noticed lacks basic performance and will begin to exhibit these issues and defects no later than 6 months into operation. I suspected it was my Internet Service Provider or Router that was the problem at first when I began to have increased and unexpected as well as unexplained internet outages. Knowing Cox had a history of preferring Arris brand equipment, I never suspected I would encounter problems with their products. After I could not ignore the unexplained connection drops and unusual amount of internet outages I finally uncovered this cable modem was the culprit, however was too late to recover the investment. It wasn't until a Cox technician noticed the unusually slow and odd way this modem rebooted after a connection drop and told me he had nothing but problems with this brand of equipment he never encountered with the others. I began to look into the problems with this product, and started to see a noticeable pattern of dissatisfaction from customers like myself. I have replaced this cable modem now with the Motorola MB8600 and had success with the modem and absolutely no issues since purchasing it. The MB8600 worked right out of the box, which I cannot speak for it down the road, but already seems more promising that any of the Arris brand products I have unfortunately purchased in the past. I thought I would provide a review on this product as I am able to speak now to the longevity of this Arris Cable Modem model SB8200 and a few other Arris products that failed prior to this one. This investment I made was a big mistake so hopefully this can help you make an informed decision which I strongly caution you all with purchasing this product.",1,AZDesertMonsoons89,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2022"
Amazon,Networking_Devices,wifi modem,R1XTHNYPM3OA1,Best mid-range value modem,"So I've had this modem for a few weeks. I used to have a Motorola Surfboard 6141 I believe (going off memory). That modem at times would randomly drop speeds down to 1mb/s maximum for no reason, then throttle back up. I tried to research this and found out it might have been related to the Time Warner Maxx internet package I have (I'm grandfathered into a package that currently doesn't exist). No idea how or why that would matter but it seems to be the reason why my old Surfboard was having problems. So a deal hit and I dropped cash for this modem in hopes I could solve this problem fairly cheaply and so far its working. I haven't noticed any lag, no strange behavior like dropping to 1mb/s speeds, its been consistent and constant fast speeds, even above the stated speeds I should receive. The unit is well ventilated so the concern of heating up is not an issue. It's barely warm to the touch. I think as others have stated, if you put this in a confined space, for example an entertainment center with a glass door, then it'll heat up more than likely because there's no internal fan. But if you provide adequate air circulation then it'll function perfectly from my point of view. Also I wasn't able to successfully hook up the unit and remotely update to Time Warner that I am switching modems (Mac address) so I had to call them.

Gotta be right up on it dang near to get connected. I have it running with an even more horrible Tenda router. I even bought a WiFi booster and still no reach. And it’s tiny as heck. Over half the size lesser than my rental modem. I think I wanna keep paying the fees and return this. Update: March 20, 2023: I am changing my review from 1 star to 4 stars. If you need a modem, that you plan on using a router with, this could work. My COX internet service started going in and out. Tried troubleshooting the matter. Cox says they need to charge a technician out to my house. $75 to have someone come fix the very internet I am paying for. So I told them let me think about. ( that’s like paying for a medium steak, getting well done, and they charge you to have a chef come out and remake the very steak you paid for but aren’t getting) so I just Pulled this bad boy out of hiding, blew the dust off and reactivated it. Had a separate Cox rep swap the modem out. She did not try to charge me a tech. She was very nice and fast. And now I’m interneted up again lol. The difference now is, instead of that sorry, sorry excuse of a router by tenda, I’m using the very GREAT Rockspace Mesh 3 box set extender system. And I couldn’t be happier. The thing about this modem is it’s only one output. You could plug your cpu directly, or use a mesh. The mesh is the best bet. In the past, I had to get a larger data plan, (over $100/mo) bc the internet sucked. Cox upsold my plan. But check your equipment before letting ppl charge you. Now, I have a more basic plan, so I’m paying less, and still able to use all my devices just the same. And the netgear has stepped in place of the very heavy duty Panoramic Gateway equipment they give you. And so far, it is working exceptionally . So I actually would recommend this modem, paired with Rockspace Mesh system. And you got yourself some connectivity to knock your socks off. Very impressed. Btw: it was a little difficult to pair, bc I used it prior, so I had to reset both the netgear and Rockspace with their reset buttons to have the names revert back to the original SSID.

Amazon,Networking_Devices,wifi modem,RROX9QFCKFI84,"Dead after 2 months - WORST customer support ever, TERRIBLE warranty coverage","This modem worked fine for a couple months. Occasional disconnects, but not frequent. Then just over a week ago it started disconnecting frequently (like several times an hour) and for several minutes at a time, even for up to 10 minutes at a time. Called their tech support (over ONE HOUR on hold just waiting for someone) and they said the problem is with my ISP (Cox). So I call them and they send out a tech. In the meantime I have to wait about a week for my ISP tech to come out, in the meantime the signal dropping gets worse and worse (like for 15-30 minutes at a time, sometimes over an hour, and happening super frequently, like basically the internet signal only lasting for 5-15 minutes at a time). Thankfully when Cox came out they didn't charge me, but they found NO problems on the line, verified it with their equipment at each point. They added a power dropper anyway to make sure. The modem got worse for the next couple days, to the point where it basically won't connect at all, and instead just keeps restarting itself looking for a signal (that it can't process). So I call Netgear tech support back for a replacement, this time TWO HOURS on hold. Finally they walk me through the same stupid steps (reset the modem, etc.), and then they say the fact that it can't connect to the internet means it's a problem with my ISP, saying they weren't configured for my modem (even though they obviously were because it worked fine for two months with no changes). Ridiculous answer - they have NO IDEA how to troubleshoot their modems, just find ways to blame it on the ISP. After getting irate for a LONG time and they finally agreed to authorize a return (RMA). Turns out if you PAY to ship it back to them, they'll eventually send you a new one (with slow shipping).

Amazon,Toys_Kids,kids toys,RKYCTN2C5Y6V4,Cute Little Cans of Play Doh - Good Color Selection,"There’s a reason Play Doh is still the go-to brand after all these years. Fun and safe. This set is packaged for shipping, not for retail shelves. Not the best price you can find, but pretty good with free shipping. 2oz cans are tiny, but not as tiny as the 1oz ones. 4oz seems standard for “full size” these days, so these cans are half sized. Old school cans (the chipboard ones with the metal bottoms) apparently held 6oz, so these are a third of what full size used to be. Though modern Play Doh may be denser. These cans do seem quite small. The color selection is great, with the six rainbow colors, black, white, hot pink and teal. Since they’re basically “travel size” cans but with a good color selection, this set would be ideal for travel. These are perfect for stocking stuffers, additions to gift bags, etc. They’d also be a great option for creating little custom Play Doh kits with unique tools not necessarily marketed for use with Play Doh - to promote creative thinking. Lots of different ways to use or gift these cans. I bought several to gift for toy drives and 100 neediest cases families.

Amazon,Toys_Kids,kids toys,R3NGL4IVYO4LDW,Unleashing Creativity with Play-Doh's 10-Pack Case of Colors,"When it comes to finding activities that both entertain and educate my children, I always strive to give them experiences that not only spark their imagination but also enhance their developmental skills. That's why I was thrilled to discover the Play-Doh Modeling Compound 10-Pack Case of Colors, exclusively available on Amazon. This delightful set has quickly become a household favorite, bringing joy and creative flair to our family's daily routine. From the moment we opened the package, the vibrant array of colors captivated everyone’s attention. The set includes ten 2 oz. cans, each filled with a different, brilliant hue. The colors are not only appealing but also inspire a multitude of creative projects. Whether it's sculpting simple shapes or crafting intricate models, these Play-Doh cans provide the perfect material for all ages, making it an ideal choice for my children, who are 2 and 5 years old. What sets this Play-Doh set apart is its commitment to safety and quality. The compound is non-toxic, making it safe for younger children who are still prone to exploring textures with their hands and mouths. As a parent, it’s reassuring to know that the products I give to my children are free from harmful chemicals and safe for their use. Each play session with our Play-Doh case turns into a mini adventure. The kids start by choosing their favorite colors and then move on to decide what they want to create. On one occasion, my eldest decided to make a colorful garden with blue, green, and yellow Play-Doh, while my youngest was happy rolling balls and making small figures. Their creativity was astounding, and it was a joy to see their different personalities shine through their creations. The quality of the Play-Doh is commendable. Unlike some other modeling clays that dry out quickly or crumble, this compound retains its elasticity and vibrancy even after many uses. It's also easy to clean up, which as any parent knows, is a huge plus. We simply gather any stray pieces, store them back in their respective cans, and they're good as new for next time. Moreover, the addition of non-toxic Play-Doh to our play routine has provided a tactile learning experience for my children. Manipulating the dough helps develop their motor skills, and distinguishing between colors teaches them about the visual spectrum. They also learn problem-solving as they figure out how to manipulate the dough to match their creative vision. To enhance our Play-Doh sessions, we often incorporate educational themes. For example, we've used the dough to practice numbers and letters. I ask my children to form the shapes of different numbers and letters with the dough, which makes learning more interactive and fun. We also use the dough to form shapes and objects that relate to the stories we read together, deepening their understanding and engagement with the material. The inclusivity of Play-Doh also encourages sharing and cooperative play. My children have learned to share colors and tools, take turns showcasing their creations, and even collaborate on joint projects, like building a Play-Doh zoo that houses all sorts of colorful animals. These are valuable social skills that they carry into their interactions at preschool and playdates. In conclusion, the Play-Doh Modeling Compound 10-Pack Case of Colors has been a fantastic addition to our family’s playtime. It not only entertains my children but also serves as a tool for education and social development. The safety, quality, and vibrancy of this product make it a worthwhile purchase for any family with young children. I wholeheartedly recommend it to any parent looking to enrich their child's playtime with creativity and learning. Every can of Play-Doh holds a rainbow of potential, and we look forward to many more hours of fun and creation.",5,daniel,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2024"

My daughter lit up like a Christmas tree when she saw it—totally worth it for the joy on her face. But let’s talk about my Christmas Eve. Trying to assemble this thing at 9pm, sleep-deprived and fueled by candy cane rage, was like being handed blueprints to the Death Star, told “you got this,” and then blindfolded while Luke Skywalker starts his trench run. Pieces the size of small macaroni’s. Instructions translated from ancient Martian. One piece mysteriously labeled “Part 4B” when no such thing exists in this universe. I stared into the abyss, and the abyss was shaped like a dollhouse roof panel. That said, once the final screw was in and my mental breakdown was complete, it looked amazing. It’s sturdy, adorable, and my kid immediately moved in like it was rent-controlled. She loves it. I needed a nap and possibly a support group. So yes 5 stars for cuteness and joy. 2 stars for the assembly process. Average that out however your sanity allows.

Very versatile. Functioned as described / expected. Each of the 4 tablets included the stylus. At first, I thought a couple of them had suffered damage from shipping, but it was just from pressure on the screen. The tablets don’t turn off, so pressure on the screen will create light. I unlocked the delete toggle on the back, pressed the delete button, and voila… no more marks on the screen. Then I just slid them back into their individual sleeves. This 4-pack is a decent deal for a lower quantity. Colors were as expected. I tested em before gifting. These little tablets are very simple - easy to use. The provided stylus does a great job with fine lines and responds well to even the slightest bit of pressure. The locking feature is nice… to prevent accidental deletion of “precious” artwork. Didn’t have to change the battery, but seems pretty straight forward. There’s a tiny screw on the tablet edge. Loosen to pop out the old coin battery. Replace. Then retighten the screw.

They are easy to draw on and easy to erase. I cannot speak for the battery life or longevity as I just recently purchased them. They are thin and very light and look nice. The only two issues I had with them is the pen is a bit hard to remove and they would be so much better if they came with magnets. They have the spots where magnets usually would be, however finding magnets for them I have found is an absolute nightmare. All the ones you can cut to shape and all of that do not hold it or are not thick enough to fill up the space for it. These are definitely a five-star item for just simple laying around the house use, but my entire use of them is notes on the refrigerator. I have a boogie board that I absolutely love but I cannot find them at a good value anymore. The bottom of mine broke so the pen does not stay in very well which is why I was replacing it. If these had a pen that was not so tough to get out I would give them five stars all day. They are not listed as being magnetic so that is totally not on the item, I just wanted people to be aware that if you're buying them with the thought of aftermarket magnets you will have a hard time finding something to fit the area made for them.",4,marty,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2025"

Right away I noticed the quality has gone downhill from my old version. The game board is barely thicker than posterboard so you'll need to be very careful with that. The cards are beyond thin - I had to laminate each one to give it longevity. The Candyland story insert was ripped upon receipt. Better quality materials need to be used since young kids are using this. Aside from quality problems, we love the classic game. My 4 and 10 year olds love the game, even though the 10 year old is way old for it, but we like to play as a family. It's the competitiveness for her that keeps her interested. Game play is simple, you choose cards and go the matching color, some spaces are double colors to move 2 instead of one. The best part is the specialty cards, in this version some of the characters are different such as the ice cream for Duke of Swirl and Grandma Gooey. What makes the game so fun is that you can be all the way at the end and get a specialty card like the cupcake that sends you back. My 4 year old is learning sight words, but can't read yet and no reading is required for this game. Each round can take 2-7 minutes depending on what cards you get, good for kids with short attention span. Classic family fun!",4,Olivia Stabler,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2022"

Amazon,Toys_Kids,children games,R2OKVDNMWVE01P,Amazing Interactive Device for Kids — Keeps Them Active and Engaged!,"The Nex Playground turned out to be one of the best kids’ tech purchases we’ve made in a long time. It’s a small cube-shaped camera that connects to the TV and tracks children’s movements in the room. No controllers, no remotes — the kids themselves become the characters on the screen. It feels like having an interactive playground right in the living room. ✅ Easy Setup Setting it up took just a couple of minutes. You plug it into the power and into your TV with HDMI, follow a few simple on-screen steps, and it’s ready to go. The device calibrates the room, connects to Wi-Fi, and immediately recognizes players. ✅ Truly Active Play What I love most is that this is not passive screen time. My kids jump, run, reach, dance, and move constantly during the games. After 20–30 minutes they’re happy, tired “in a good way,” and definitely more active than they would be with a tablet or phone. ✅ Great Variety of Games The game library is surprisingly diverse. There are sports games, dancing games, obstacle courses, fun coordination mini-games, and even cooperative challenges for siblings or friends. You can choose games for different ages and moods, which is perfect for families with multiple kids. ✅ Very Kid-Friendly The interface is simple, bright, and easy for children to navigate. There are no controllers to drop, lose, or break. Kids just stand in front of the TV and move — that’s it. Even younger kids figure it out almost instantly. ✅ Fun for the Whole Family This isn’t only for kids! Adults can join in and play too, and it turns into a super fun family activity. Great for rainy days, weekends, or playdates. ⸻ ⭐ What I Appreciate Most • Encourages physical activity • Helps reduce phone/tablet time • Kids stay engaged and entertained for a long time • Works well for single players or groups • Turns the living room into an interactive game space ⸻ ⚠️ Things to Keep in Mind Nothing major, but a few practical notes: • You need a bit of space in front of the TV for the camera to see the players properly. • Good lighting improves accuracy. Dim rooms can make the tracking less precise. • Younger kids can sometimes run out of frame and the device may “lose” them briefly — easily fixed by marking a play zone with a rug or tape. • A stable Wi-Fi connection helps games load faster. ⸻ ✅ Final Verdict The Nex Playground is a fantastic alternative to passive screen time and a great way to keep kids active, engaged, and laughing. The tracking works really well, the setup is quick, and the game selection is excellent. My kids absolutely love it, and I highly recommend it to any family looking for fun, movement, and something different from traditional video games.

You can really tell the folks who developed these games are kids at heart and poured their love of motion controlled games into this project! I've had the Nex Playground for over a year and we couldn't be happier with it! There are some great games for people of all ages! Including adults! My 4 year old daughter uses it several times a week. Even my 11 and 13 year old boys enjoy playing it! I take it to work on ""Fun Fridays"". I'm a Cas Manager for adults with disabilities. Some of them only have the use of one arm and because of the AI body tracking these people who have never played a video game in their lives are having the time of their lives! My favorites are the bowling game (wow, how accurate the ball follows your hand movement), connect 4/basketball game, the baseball game (a huge hit with my boys and my clients), the mini game compilation game (ridiculous fun), the cookie monster puzzle game (cooperative gaming fun), the Mario kart inspired racing game (takes me back to the Wii era), the arrow shooting game (super fun to aim and hit targets), Zumba (is a great workout) and there are so much more and even more games are released throughout the year! I really believe this console deserves a place in every home in America! It's such a great time! A great workout! And I hope Nintendo is paying close attention!

Amazon,Gardening_Outdoor,lawn tools,R8J012XEVKRU1,Great battery mower!!!,"Have had this mower for several months now and am ready to offer my opinion ... I really do like this mower!! This is the first battery operated mower I have owned and was a bit worried when I bought it. We have a little over a 1/4 acre and our yard is mostly flat. Have had many gas powered mowers and was ready to try the battery craze!! And, I'm glad I did. The mower operates smoothly - is very quiet and light weight. Glad I did not opt to spend the extra money on self propelled. One battery will usually do the whole yard - about 35-45 minutes of run time. The height adjustment is easy - the few controls are easy - the whole process -- easy!! Loading the battery is simply. No vibration. No running to get gas in the can. No gas can in the garage. Very simple to operate and own. Does a nice job of cutting. I do the mulching option and will eventually try the bag just to see what it's like. Bought several other tools from this company and am happy with them all - and having extra batteries (the one battery fits all is a MUST and really works well). The only negative about this mower is the size - I purchased the smaller 16"" cutting path and, although I really don't need bigger, it might save a little time (ok, just being a bit lazy to be honest!!). I would recommend this mower and this brand. Make sure each tool uses the same battery - just a suggestion - because it makes life easier with 3 batteries - there is always one charged and ready. (I also bought the weed eater and blower for those curious) Great product and I only hope I'm still this happy with it next year and the year after ..... happy mowing!",5,Joseph,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2025"
Amazon,Gardening_Outdoor,lawn tools,RNTPAZLUBEU90,Best mower I’ve ever had! So done with gas.,"I bought this in July of 2020. It’s the 16”. I needed something to cut regular grass, but had nowhere to store it. I kept a plywood panel over it as a lean to in the winter, but rain and snow would still get in on it. In 2023 winter, it had absolutely no cover. I’ve since moved to a place without real grass but tons of honeysuckle bushes and weeds, and I’ve used it heavily to keep acres of it cut down. I just finally bought a new blade for it, since I had beat up mine enough. This thing isn’t super strong or big, but it’s undergone so much hard labor I am so impressed it’s still going strong. The battery lasts long, no problems. The value for the money has definitely been amazing. I’ve used it each year heavily. If I were to get another one, I’d prob get a larger size just cuz now I have acreage, but same time, so impressed with this little mower as is!!! Lightweight, easy for me and the kids to manage. Love it!!",5,Lora,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2025"
Amazon,Gardening_Outdoor,lawn tools,R2P2BDGP5LBMC8,My first lawnmower for my first lawn-,"I couldn't spend too much, and didn't know what to expect, so because the lawn hadn't been mowed in at least a couple months- it was overgrown when I took possession a month ago, and is probably 7 inches long in some spots- I had to get a mower, and was overwhelmed with all the choices. I'm not mechanically inclined, & if anything can be done backwards, I always end up getting it backwards & have to redo it... Assembly of this out of the box was pretty easy. You just have to add the upper handle and the clipping-catch bag, and charge the battery. Now, some of the issues I had are probably due to the long and slightly-damp-underneath grass I had to cut. I may not get another chance to mow before it snows. It's been raining more days than it's been dry lately. I thought this mower would be sufficient because it said it could mow 1/3 an acre on a charge, which is about what I have between the back and front yard. I also have a pretty bad back, so I knew I wouldn't be able to do the entire lawn without a break at least every hour. I tend to overdo it, so if a dead battery forces me to stop & take a break, that is for the best. In the end, I only got half the back yard done yesterday on the one battery charge...and now it's raining again, which it's predicted to do until it starts snowing in a couple days. Part of the problem is also that there is a big tree in the back yard plus neighbor's trees dropping leaves into my yard, and I've been trying to get all the leaves off the ground before mowing, and it's impossible! I thought a thin layer of leaves would be okay, but no. It was just too much for the mower, with the grass so long too. I had to keep stopping to rake because the clippings were jamming up the blade and underneath. So I had to rake more leaves and bag up the clippings around it. Yes, it does have a catch bag, but only about half the clippings make it into the bag; the rest stay on the ground as mulch, even when you first start mowing! That part disappoints me, because after the mowing is done, you still have to rake up mounds of mulch (yes, I removedd the mulch piece because I didn't want any, but maybe I got that backwards). The manual did leave a few explanations out. It is kind of hard for me to push, but I am more than half disabled. I probably should have paid the extra approx. $200 for the self-propelled model- but that is so much money for someone on a fixed income. Again, I think a big part of the problem was the too overgrown grass. I first tried the shortest setting, but that was impossible to push over that heavy grass! I used setting 2, which was still hard to push, but with the days left before winter being so few, I had to. Hence my having to unjam it every few minutes. Next year I'll be able to mow more often, and not let it get so out of control! I didn't have the problem someone else mentioned about it stalling while pulling back on a hill. My yard is pretty hilly/bumpy in spots, but that wasn't a problem. The manual said all 4 wheels have to be on the ground, but if they briefly aren't, it still works. I haven't gotten to the part under the tree with all the acorns- I'll be wearing safety glasses as the manual instructs. I will still need an edger/weed whacker, because you can't get too close to the garden beds/walkway/fence/tree, etc. with this mower. I guess the same would be true for any mower. I do wish I had bought the wider model, and the 2-battery model. Lawn mowing with this model is a lot of work for me. But I think I'll keep it, and next year will vow to mow regularly so it doesn't jam so much. The biggest disappointment of all is that all the clippings don't make it into the bag, and that leaves on the ground can't be mowed over. Hopefully I won't be too crippled next year to mow, because I really want to get in shape, and this push mower is very good exercise! Also- I love the color, and it's cute and not TOO heavy. The battery is average power toll-size, so that doesn't add weight, just the mower body itself.",4,Star,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2025"
Amazon,Gardening_Outdoor,lawn tools,R2I5EEM5BKI4XF,"""A man's got to know his limitations."" - Excellent mower!","When Dirty Harry says ""A man's got to know his limitations."" that's true for this mower. If you're a dingbat who doesn't mow their lawn for weeks on end until the grass is so high a gas mower craps out every three feet, then this mower isn't for you. In fact a gas mower isn't for you, just hire someone and get it done. Alternatively you could wait until a You-tuber who does sympathy mows for neglected yards shows up at your door and offers to clean up your hovel. The mower is easy to use and requires very little maintenance. I have a 15 year old son who would rather be a goldbrick than mow when needed. I bought a couple of extra aftermarket batteries for him when he slacks and waits until the grass is so high we're about to be justifiably pestered by the HOA. I personally like the mower. It's very quiet, cuts well, and easy to maneuver. Battery capacity could be greater, but it's fine for a typical lawn that is mowed weekly. The self propel feature works great. You can collect the clippings, side discharge, or mulch. I always mulch. The only maintenance I anticipate is sharpening/changing the blade and keeping the mower clean.

Multi-tasking, cooking too high. Almost burning food. Mind you, we have food allergies/sensitivities, so I must cook all our food from scratch. I cook more than 5 meals a day as a homeschooling mommy of 2. (Family of 4.) . The sets usually last me 10 month torturing them. Still non stick After scratching and the ceramic looking dark and seasoned from overheating. Shopping around, I ended up going with Carote a 3rd time. This time I am being much more careful. Starting on medium and then turning it a bit down. I am still getting crispy bacon, browned chicken nuggets made from scratch etc. My last two sets were dark grey and dark cream. This bright cream set worried me. I have made plenty of red spaghetti sauce with no staining. I did read reviews and made sure I chose their line with the name granite in it this purchase. Now that I am cooking intentionally, my pans are not turning dark on the bottom interior and exterior. They are lasting much longer. If you get a defective handle. Being they are wood, they will replace. I do not submerge the lids in water, so water doesn't get in between the hollow area of the glass and handle. I love Carote. This set will definitely last me over a year this time. I was too scared to do the stainless steel having to worry about where they are made as each brand has many coming from different places, lawsuits, and the concern with really being careful. I like the silicone spatula it comes with. Nice size, and my girls like the colorful sprinkle design. I am so happy not having to spend hundreds on a set that disappoints. These are better than the home store brands that sell indvidual ceramic pieces. These do not stick and last way longer. I have had this set for a few months now and they are still looking brand new. When it comes to stacking any pots and pans, I use the fabric star looking things my first Carote set came with to put in between for storage. I am buying another set. I just love the sizes.

Amazon,Kitchen_Dining,cookware,R23XABBO2241XG,My new favorite cookware!,"We used non-stick cookware for years before we ditched it for stainless steel & cast iron because of health concerns. We've not been entirely thrilled with stainless steel - I suppose it's better for your health, but the cleanup is awful - stuff sticks to it like crazy and I'm constantly either madly scrubbing it, or putting it back on the stove with water to boil off whatever food got cooked onto it before trying to clean it with soapy water. Cast iron is awesome in certain situations, like searing steak, but I've also found it a challenge to maintain so I don't strip the ""seasoning"" off of it. I've heard and read great things about ceramic non-stick cookware, but until having an opportunity to try this set, I just wasn't willing to take the leap. Let me tell you - I absolutely love this 9 piece ceramic cookware set - it does not disappoint! - It is cleverly designed - perfect for smaller kitchens with less storage space. There is one universal handle that clips easily onto each piece, the lid for the saucepan has an elevated lip so the handle still fits while securely covering the pot - The nonstick surface heats quickly and evenly, and was perfectly stick-resistant, even with scrambled eggs (see pic), which I have found stick to absolutely everything and are a huge mess to clean up! The eggs slid off like magic, & once the pan was cool, a quick wash in warm water with mild dish soap got it squeaky clean. So awesome! One important note - though the set comes with basic instructions, there is no mention of whether or not you should add cooking oil to the pan. I looked it up, and the internet consensus is that using a bit of butter or oil (though not spray oil) will not only make the non-stick surface work better, but it will also protect and preserve the non-stick surface by keeping it oiled. Kind of seems like an important point to miss in the directions, so I thought I'd mention it here... - I love the thoughtful inclusion of the 2 sturdy fabric storage protectors... I usually use paper towels to protect my non-stick cookware when it's stacked in the cabinet, but they don't do a great job protecting the surface, they slide all over the place, and eventually fall to the back of the cabinet, which is super annoying. So having these cute and sturdy pan protectors to stack everything neatly is a huge bonus. - Along the same lines, I love that 2 handy silicone utensils are included with the set, so that you can use everything right out of the box! Honestly, if I didn't have non-scratch utensils on hand and got this set, I can see myself using the wrong kind of utensil in my enthusiasm to try out the set, potentially scratching the set right out of the box. I can't imagine I'm the only person who would do that, so it's awesome that utensils are included right in the package. - That said, while the spatula is perfect, the ladle is kind of comically large for the small saucepan included in this set. It appears that some sets include a larger pot, in that case the ladle makes sense. Still, it is nice to have on hand. - This set is a great value - really reasonable for what you get, plus other cookware that I have seen in stores are so much more expensive! - The blue and white color scheme is so cheerful - it brightens my kitchen and makes me smile! All of my other cookware has always been gray and black, that is fine, but I was pleasantly surprised how much joy the color of this set brings me - This set would make a great housewarming gift, and it's also perfect for college students who are living in small, dorm-sized apartments My only wish is that lids were provided for the saute pans - the lids from my stainless steel set do work with these standard size pans, but if you're starting out and this is your first set, it's a shame that the lids for each piece aren't included. Overall, I can't recommend this set highly enough - totally love it!",5,Anna Smith,FALSE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2025"
Amazon,Kitchen_Dining,cookware,R1883SN52JDNUT,Good functional cookware,"I got this cookware set a little while back to try out because I wanted something versatile for everyday cooking without sacrificing space in the cabinets, and honestly it’s been mostly pleasant to use. Right out of the box it looked nicer than I expected for the price — the pieces are a good mix of sizes for all the things I cook most often, and the detachable handles are actually way more useful than I thought they’d be. Being able to snap the handles on and off means I can stack everything up neatly in the cupboard, and when I need to go from the stovetop to the oven it’s less of a juggling act compared to my old set. Cooking on induction and gas has both been fine, and nothing has stuck to the surfaces yet even when I was less careful than I should’ve been. Cleaning up is pretty easy too — I’ve wiped them down after dinner and they haven’t shown weird residue or stains. The lids fit snugly, which helps with both simmering and keeping splatters down, and I’ve even used them in the oven a couple times without worrying about the handles. That said, the finish on these isn’t crazy heavy duty — if you’re used to thick professional pans you’ll feel the difference, and I’ve noticed the heat distribution takes a bit longer to get even than my old set. Also the detachable handles take a moment to get used to, especially when you've got hot stuff inside, since you do have to make sure they’re clicked on solidly before moving anything. And while everything stacks nicely, it does take a couple extra seconds to click the handles on and off every time you use them. Overall, it’s been a solid addition to my kitchen. I like how flexible the pieces are and how much easier it is to store them without the bulky handles in the way. For everyday cooking it checks all the boxes for me, and I’ve reached for it way more than I thought I would when I first opened the box.",5,Mike P,FALSE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2025"
Amazon,Kitchen_Dining,cookware,R1PZBMFMEGOJ5I,"Compact, Beautiful, and Perfect for Small Kitchens or First Apartments","This Malta Blue Carote set is such a pleasant surprise. The color is bright and cheerful without feeling childish, and the ceramic interior gives it a clean, polished look. Although this is a smaller nine piece set, the essentials are all here. You get two frying pans, a saucepan with a silicone rimmed lid, utensils, pan protectors, and the removable handle system. Everything feels sturdy, and the nonstick performance is just as reliable as the larger Carote sets I already own. One of the standout features is how beginner friendly this set is. Someone who is just setting up a kitchen does not need a dozen specialty pieces. They need the core pieces that will carry them through everyday meals, and this set delivers exactly that. The detachable handle design keeps the whole collection compact, and once the handle is removed, the pieces nest tightly together. It saves a tremendous amount of cabinet space, which is especially helpful for new cooks who may be working with a limited kitchen. The silicone lid also makes it easy to cook, store, and reheat in the same pot without moving food around. This set also makes a thoughtful gift. It is affordable without feeling cheap, and it gives the recipient a practical but attractive start. Whether it is for someone moving into a dorm, a first apartment, or even an RV, this little set checks every box. It heats evenly, it cleans beautifully, and it looks far more expensive than the current price. A lovely, useful, confidence boosting starter set.

Amazon,Kitchen_Dining,cookware,RI1VJ2864IFLQ,I don't know why I didn't go stainless steel until now! - update,"The media could not be loaded. UPDATE: I just had to update this review. I fried an egg and as you can see, with the proper knowledge, this egg slid around the pan just like those fancy pots and pans with little to no clean up.! I don't like to cook, I do not eat a lot of fried foods and I rarely give 5 stars. I did my homework on cooking with stainless steel. You CAN NOT cook the same as you have on that nasty nonstick stuff. I wanted to wait until I used both a saucepan and frypan. Saucepan: I boil my chicken and add Mrs. Dash to the water. Normally, there would be bubbling/seasoning stuck all over the sides at this point. The pictures shows no sticking and even boiling. They had been boiling for at least 20 minutes. I did put a little veggie oil in the water. It cleaned up VERY easy, dried immediately (do your homework!) and is just fine. Frying (uncovered): I heated the pan, tested with water and then added my oil (olive oil this time) (all as instructed by DOING MY HOMEWORK). Onions was all I had, so I cut them up and put them in for sautéing. Once they started to brown, I reduced the heat from low/medium to low. I stirred them until I was happy with the coloring and then took my 2 squares of ground turkey (I package my meat in single servings to freeze) laid them on top of the onions, salt and peppered them and cut them into sections for frying. After about 10 minutes I went back and they moved easily with NO sticking. After 20 minutes I flipped them and dumped some parmesan cheese on top. Once done, I removed them and made 3 meals out of it. You can see the condition of the pan immediately after removing the food. It is nearly clean and there's still oil in the pan! I could have easily washed it at that point, but I wanted to eat :) I put some hot water in the pan and set it back on the burner, now turned off. I went out 30 minutes later and was able to wipe it clean with just a warm soapy dish rag. Easy peasy! Utensil: A wooden spoon (of sorts). It only has a slight depression so I guess it's not really a 'spoon', however, it is what I used for the entire process, flipping and all. This is just a basic set, but it is all ""I"" need. I have a cast iron grill pan for steaks and bacon and a small one for a turkey burger when I'm in a hurry. Also, I used the cardboard inserts they came with for spacers until I found-https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087M6W31J?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details. Who knew of such things :) So, in conclusion for all those bad reviews (most are of burnt food), that's what you get for not researching how to cook with stainless steel. It's just too bad that the vendor had to take the hit for your ignorance. Taken care of correctly (and I don't think it's a lot of work, frankly, it's easier than those nasty 'nonstick' pans) these are amazing and I got them on sale for $140! I did a lot of looking before I settled on this set. It's very comparably priced and I would grab them up before they're discontinued. I also got the small saucepan for this set from Lowe's.

Amazon,Kitchen_Dining,cookware,R3P777PUOTX5C6,Very Impressive Cookware,"This is my first stainless steel cookware set, and I did some research before I started cooking. This set is very nice and comfortable when cooking. Very durable to high heat and clean up was easy. There were no hot spots and my chicken came out cooked evenly. I used these tips when searing my chicken and this should be done when using stainless steel: -Wash your cookware before using with a detergent that doesn't have citrus in it. No lemon fresh Dawn. Just use regular dish detergent. -Heat your pan for 2 minutes before adding oil or food. You have to take it from cold to hot before adding oil. Or your food will stick. Use low to medium heat. Check with some drops of water to see if they bead up. Then you're ready to cook. -Fat and Butter is Stainless Steel's best friend. After heating your pan for 2 minutes use Avocado or Grapeseed oil to make cooking surface non stick, not Olive oil or regular butter. Olive oil and butter are not durable fats and oils to sustain the heat in stainless steel, but they are for non stick. Avocado and Grapeseed oil burns slower on high heat. -You can tell when you heat is too high if your oil starts drying out. Add a splash more during cooking. -Turn the heat down some when cooking. You only need the higher heat to get the pan hot. Once hot, you can reduce heat. Stainless steel is not like nonstick. It's very different. If your food burns, you had your pan too hot or you used the wrong oil or not enough oil. Towards the end of cooking you can add your butter because you should have had time to lower the temperature. Just don't add butter at the beginning. -When you take your meat out of the pan to rest, let your pan cool for a few minutes and then wash while meat is resting. Perfect time to wash cookware! Wash in warm to hot water. Cold water will make hot stainless steel warp. Use gentle detergent. I also used the soft side of Scrub Daddy because it's gentle to stainless steel. If you have tougher stains, use Brillo or SOS pads. -Dry your cookware immediately after washing to preserve the finish. Additional tip: Brillo pads are good to clean stainless steel. Don't be afraid to use Brillo or SOS. It even says so on the box.",5,Sinclair Jacobs,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2024"

I seasoned each of them before use and haven't had to redo it yet (using for several months now). When cooking sauces, gravy, pudding, etc. everything just runs down the side of the pot while stirring. Nice, well fitting lids. Hard to believe the hype about cookware, especially non-stick, but if they continue to hold up like they have for the last year or so they might actually be the last pans I have to buy.

Amazon,Kitchen_Dining,cookware,R2VS6MZFAH2JVL,Great quality and versatility - and fun to use,"Really happy with the set so far. Also purchased the pans from Costco. After years of buying lower quality pans, which normally are only good for a few years, we are very impressed with the performance so far. The pots and pans feel solid, and I am really impressed with the lids, too. Our gas cooktop's steel grates have beat up the bottoms of sets in the past, but the bottoms of the Hexclads are handling them well so far. Perhaps my only small complaint is that the handles and lids are too shiny to hide fingerprints or smudges even after they are washed. Reading through endless reviews about Hexclad and other high end brands, I've concluded the following: 1. For our cooking needs, which is versatility and family use, these were the best fit. Our goal was not to buy the last set in our lifetime or the absolute best in the world, but something that is non-stick, easy to use for our kids (i.e., not stainless), and lasts for more than a couple years. 2. A fair amount of negative reviews (and those with photos) were questionable. Lots of complaints about the non-stick with photos of dirty pans. I could not help but feel like directions were not followed, such as proper heating up, seasoning of pans (initial and oils during regular use) and just general care. We have cooked all sorts of things so far and have not had issues. 3. With a number of complaints about customer service from Hexclad directly, we decided to purchase ours from Costco and Amazon. I feel like quality issues with products are known pretty quickly, so I am confident we will be okay should anything arise in the short term, which we can go through Amazon or Costco. If you cannot replace an item 5-10 years down the road due to cost or whatever, you should not be playing in this price point in the first place. Again, this is for casual home use with a large family, where we did not want to get into stainless steel type cookware, which I'm sure is amazing - but not for a family with kids. We wanted something that was great quality and did not require any guesswork into the use and care.

I read reviews for many sets & was not looking to spend a fortune on a silverware set as these are for my vacation home I recently acquired & need some good basic things like these. This silverware set in reviews looked the best choice & price wise I ordered. Was NOT disappointed ! Alot of reviews with other sets of stainless steel had claims of early rust issues were this one did not have those issue claims (that I saw in reviews). You also have the choice of a normal & heavy duty set, I went with the normal & WoW these are sturdy ! The necks of the forks are ""meaty"" so not going to bend unless you REALLY put abnormal amount of pressure on them. Small spoon nice size as are the salad forks, the larger fork if perfect sized & although some reviewed the large spoon too big, I find it nice & large for soup as they should be ! Overall VERY happy with the quality, weight & feel in hand as they don't feel like flimsy, cheap metal that will bend while stabing at a lettuce leaf, lol.

These forks don’t mess around. Each piece feels solid in the hand—none of that flimsy, bend-on-impact nonsense. I could probably use a spoon as a small shovel in an emergency. The knives?

Amazon,Mens_Clothing,mens clothing,R385K8YJS22CLP,Several things to be aware of,"FOR REFERENCE: I bought 2 of the sweatshirts in Stonewash Green, sizes Medium and Large. My intent was to find something reasonably priced, warm, and comfy to wear - mainly so I could quickly put together a basic, casual, and decent looking outfit that was suitable to wear in public. I wanted a sweatshirt I could launder at least 15 times before it became too worn out looking to try to wear at a social event. Even after the appearance degraded, I still wanted the sweatshirt to remain warm, comfy, and in tact so I could wear it while lounging inside my home or during other situations that didn't require me to look quite as put together. I'm a female, 5'6 tall, about 115 lbs, 32C bra size, 26 inch waist, and 36.5 inch hips. I have slightly broader shoulders and a slightly longer torso than the average female of my size. I have a slender build. I wanted one sweatshirt to fit pretty loose (for layering and comfort) and another to have a trendy oversized looked. I definitely should have bought larger sizes, and I don't think these sweatshirts will hold up the way I had hoped. MAIN THOUGHTS: Overall quality is ""barely okay."" (I guess it really depends on how you intend to use this sweatshirt and the pricing. You may find the quality to be acceptable... or very disappointing.) Shrinks a lot after just one wash - almost by a size and a half. Shrinkage is more drastic in the length of the body and sleeves, but also affects the width. Overall, does not launder well under ""normal conditions."" You may have to be very careful to avoid any heat or abrasiveness to keep this sweatshirt looking its best for as long as possible. (Not worth the effort, IMO.) Stains show easily on this particular color and are surprisingly difficult to remove. Possible dye issues. The large sweatshirt came out with what appears to be bleached/faded spots on the bottom banding. (We don't use bleach or a lot of harsh chemicals in my home due to allergies and skin sensitivity issues. So, I'm not sure how this occured. No other clothing item came out of the laundry with the same problem.) Already noticed some slight pilling in spots. Barely noticeable now, but this is only after one laundry session. Sweatshirts aren't very warm, but they are comfortable (as long as you get the correct size). If you choose to buy this sweatshirt, I'd recommend you buy 1-2 sizes larger to account for shrinkage and to allow for layering. If you only plan to wear a thin tank top underneath, you probably don't need to size up too much. But if you plan to wear a long sleeve thermal underneath and still want a loose fit, I'd go up 2 sizes. MORE SPECIFIC DETAILS: This sweatshirt is between light-weight and mid-weight thickness. It's more suitable to wear during chilly/cooler days in the Fall or Spring. It's not enough to keep someone warm during very cold Winter weather without adding several layers underneath and on top. I wore both sweatshirts twice before washing them. Once with only a tank top underneath, and once with a thin long sleeve thermal underneath. Then I machine washed them in semi-warm water and dried them on medium heat (being careful not to leave them in the dryer more than necessary). BEFORE LAUNDERING: Both sweatshirts felt slightly rough (nothing really bothersome or too noticeable) and disappointingly thin. The color was as expected - a lovely muted, pale green. One sweatshirt arrived with excess threads hanging from the bottom. But I was able to safely cut them off without risk of anything unraveling. I liked the way both tops fit and draped. The sizes were as I hoped they would be. I accidentally spilled a cold, milky coffee drink on the smaller sweatshirt. I treated it with a pre-wash stain remover. Then threw both sweatshirts in the washer with a pair of jeans and no-lint sports towel (all similar colors as the sweatshirts). AFTER LAUNDERING: Both tops became softer and slightly fluffier after washing. This made them feel a bit thicker and warmer. Both were noticably smaller, though. The large top now fits similar to the way the medium used to fit. Except it's a tad bit shorter. Both tops no longer drape the way they did before I washed them. It's not a huge issue for me, though. The banding on both tops also shrank a bit. I no longer like the way the medium fits me. Prior to washing, the end of the sleeves reached halfway down my fingers. The sleeve cuffs were loose enough that I could have them drape that way, but just snug enough that I could pull them back around my wrists. Now the wrist cuffs sit snuggly around my wrists. When I reach for items above my head, the sleeves pull back a bit, exposing more of my wrists... and the waist hem rides up so that I have to yank it down when I drop my arms back down to my sides. (That's how badly the top shrank in length after just one wash!) The brown color from where I spilled my coffee on the medium top was gone, but there's still a visible stain. It just looks a couple shades darker than the sweatshirt color... like I spilled water on myself and it's starting to dry a bit. (I'm going to try a different stain remover and wash it again. Hopefully it works, otherwise this top will permanently look dirty.) As I already mentioned, the larger top had some pale pumkin-yellow spots on the lower banding - similar to what bleach spots would look like. I'm okay with the fit of the larger size sweatshirt even after it shrank. So, it's a shame that the color bled the way it did. Overall, I'm disappointed with my purchases. These are already going to be dedicated lounging and housework shirts. They are a bit warmer and very soft inside, which is nice. And nothing has unraveled, so it seems the stitching is good. I don't think these would be great for screen-printing, simply because of the amount of shrinkage and the fact that they're already showing signs of pilling in areas that don't get much friction. Hope this info helps. If anything, these aren't bad sweatshirts to have on hand to adapt to temperature fluctuations. They're stretchy, so they're easy to quickly throw on as an extra layer and take off as needed. Just be mindful they leave some lint behind on 100% cotton shirts. The lint problem will probably diminish after a few washes, though.",3,A.J.,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2023"

Quality buttons and stitching. The color combination was excellent. Not sure if Amazon allows mention of other brands, so I'll just say I compared it with flannel shirts that are twice as expensive. Legendary Whitetails is a bit heavier, but that's probably due to the corduroy.

Amazon,Mens_Clothing,mens clothing,R3MEA9CQS6BXLR,Great big and tall shirt for a big and tall dude,"Absolutely terrific shirts! I’m 6’6”, 320 lbs., with broad shoulders. It can be difficult to find clothes that are quality, look good, fit well, and reasonably priced. This shirt hits on all points! Immediately I tried it on. I noticed two awesome things right away: the softness of the material and the button placement. Many button down shirts these days leave a lot of fabric at the bottom where just one more button is be necessary for us tall folks. Otherwise the shirt stays tucked in but it also separates revealing one’s hairy belly button. Yikes! Cost cutting over customer satisfaction (I’m looking at you, Men’s Wearhouse). This shirt had that necessary button. The thickness of the shirt is excellent as well; nice for indoor wear. And the sleeves are long; no getting short changed here. Next came the laundry test. Many flannel shirts come out of a washing either shrunk, heavily wrinkled, or both. The shirt then looks “off” no matter what you try. This shirt (and two others I bought) came out true to size and wrinkled only slightly! I don’t own a dryer (dryers are a product of a secret society in cahoots with electric companies) so I hang dried the shirt, and it looks great! A quick steam, and it’s ready to wear. The corduroy on the collar and cuffs is a nice touch also, especially with the cuffs to add weight to the sleeves. Overall, these are my new favorites. I’ve bought three others to add to the three I’ve already purchased. With a large variety in colors, I’m sure I’ll purchase more. One tiny issue with this shirt: on the tip of one collar the pattern stopped in the white. See picture. It’s very small and won’t bother me in the slightest. But if my family notices it, they will be unrelenting in their jokes and jabs. It is what it is. :))",5,Big Red,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2025"

However, my quest for such a piece ended when I discovered the RANKEEF Tiger Eye Bracelet. This bracelet, with its 8MM natural stone beads and stretch lava rock, has quickly become an indispensable part of my daily wear. Here's why it stands out.

Whether I'm typing away at work, enjoying a casual outing, or engaging in light physical activity, this bracelet remains perfectly comfortable on my wrist.

From casual tees and jeans to more formal wear, this bracelet adds a touch of sophistication without ever feeling out of place. The tiger eye stones, known for their captivating appearance and perceived properties of bringing luck and protection, are paired with lava rock beads, adding an interesting textural contrast and visual appeal. Beyond its aesthetics, there's a certain charm to wearing a bracelet made from natural elements. The tiger eye and lava rock beads are not just visually appealing; they carry a sense of earthiness and grounding. Whether or not one subscribes to the belief in the healing properties of natural stones, there's an undeniable comfort in carrying a piece of nature with you. It serves as a subtle reminder of the world's natural beauty and complexity. Another aspect worth mentioning is the versatility of the RANKEEF Tiger Eye Bracelet. Its design is such that it can be worn alone as a statement piece or paired with other bracelets for a more layered look. This versatility makes it an excellent choice for those looking to experiment with their style or simply add a versatile piece to their accessory collection.

Amazon,Beauty_Personal_Care,skincare,R2D2FYBT0MZJQA,Effective product with initial uneasiness,"Recently after a gut bacterium imbalance, my Sebum production went higher than normal and pores became visibly large and clogged skin, leading to onset of pimples on face. I was advised to use Niacinamide based serum, I started applying just after delivery of the product and on first day I faced redness and uneasiness on face. Therefore, I skipped a day and thereafter have been applying regularly before going to bed. It also stings for a few minutes application, a sensation like burning or heat. I didn’t get any new redness or uneasiness. It doesn’t feel heavy or sticky and lasts whole night. My skin has improved within a couple of days, pores are visibly smaller and didn’t get new pimples.

Amazon,Beauty_Personal_Care,skincare,R1WXBQ56TE09TS,WOW! This really is as advertised,"This amazing product was delivered a few days ago and I have already seen some wonderful results. I bought on a whim when it was advertised as half price. I am almost 54 with some wrinkles, large pores, combination skin, and some red patchy areas. I have seen a more even skin tone, reduction in pore size, and some flattening of wrinkles. I still have my ""11's"" wrinkles but they have reduced in inrensity. Or will soften tour skin without making it feel oily. I have tried retinol and other anti-aging products. Wasted a lot of money over the years... This stuff works! It is a little sticky but a little goes a long way. After application, just wait a few minutes for it to fully absorb. I use this with a different brand of hyaluronic acid mixed with some frankincense essential oil. I think I will try other products from this company to see how they work. Highly recommend.

Every morning I wake up with BABY SOFT skin, and I love all the skin-forward ingredients. The only thing that bugged me was that it stays slightly sticky once it’s applied and my face kept sticking to my pillowcase. My sister also commented how ‘oily’ she thought my face was and I had to explain it was this cream, not my face. 🤣🤷‍♀️ Super effective, and love the value compared to other things I’ve tried for twice the price that I saw no results from whatsoever!

It makes my skin look healthy and refreshed, and I wake up in the morning with my face still feeling moisturized instead of tight or flaky. It layers great with my other products, and I’ve had zero irritation. If you have dry skin, this is honestly such a perfect moisturizer.

Amazon,Beauty_Personal_Care,skincare,R16TUOMZ0P2WAM,Good for Travel,"This was my first time using this Medicube product & I like it. It is on the heavier side & upon application, a bit sticky. However, like all skin prep products, letting it settle before applying other products is key. The stickiness goes away upon absorption by the skin. I'm inclined to use it at night or if during the day, without makeup, just sunscreen. It's weight is a bit much during the day (for me) if you like using foundation, contour, blush, powder, etc. I personally don't like layering a ton of makeup during the day - moisturizers or sunscreen, that's it. I don't find primers do much unless I'm going for the full coverage look, which is not often. I will pamper my face at night, though, and if my face looks like a glazed doughnut before I go to bed, it's happy. It has a very soothing & mosturizing feel to it, more so than some higher-end products I use. My skin is relatively dry (and mature) - the soft feel continues much longer than many products. I think this is a very good value for the money. I use Retin-A every 3 months to force a gentle peel & this feels awesome on my face when it shedding & sensitive. Nice travel size, texture & consistency. I would definitely recommend trying this if you like products with nacinamide & collagen.",5,Liz Palermo,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2025"

Sold on the results!!,"First, let me preface by saying I’m 56 years old so I have some crepey skin on my neck, crows feet and (thanks to genetics) I have bags under my eyes most days. I have tried SO MANY PRODUCTS. Clinique, Drunk Elephant, various drug store brands, and nothing really made a difference at all. This Medicube Collagen Jelly is AMAZING. My skin looks better after just 3 weeks of use than it has in years. My skin feels plump and healthy. I don’t wake up with bags under my eyes, and my turkey neck has been minimized. This even helps my hooded eyelids, when I apply it there. (I know it’s not recommend to use close to the eyes but so far I’ve had no issues when I use it on my eyelids). I know some folks don’t like the sticky texture but I only have that issue if I use too much when I apply it. I start with a small amount and build up to the amount I need. Then I put my regular moisturizer on top of it. Not only is this stuff a miracle in a jar, it’s affordable!! I am SOLD on this product with the results I’ve seen.

Amazon,Beauty_Personal_Care,skincare,RSM3HHXQNCODR,Very hydrating,"I got this set because I was traveling but I had only used the Byoma milky toner in the past and had really enjoyed that. The face wash is a tiny bit drying for dry skin types like mine but still felt good and no smell which I like. The toner I love and had already been using. Great way to get extra hydration. The serum is sort of like a thicker version of the toner but layers beautifully and adds even more moisture. The moisturizer is very good. Feels a little sticky/tacky on the skin which not everyone loves, but its great under makeup. Lastly the sunscreen is not thick, rubs in easily, and doesnt have an obnoxious scent or feel. All looks great under foundation, and when I use them at night I wake up with super glowy skin. Highly recommend.",5,Sophia Maranca,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2025"

Amazon,Beauty_Personal_Care,beauty products,R3I7B3BTUHA017,Actually work!,"Worked surprisingly well. I have allergies so I have a lot of issues with my eyes. Due to excessively rubbing my eyes along with aging, I have undereye bags forming with some wrinkles (crows feet) forming. I wasn't sure if these patches would be helpful. Considering all the products I have previously purchased with no result. These actually have helped. My eye bags are so much better after using these. I could tell a difference after one use but like most products, it's not a permanent result. The gold ones definitely have helped the most and arw the thickest ones in the box. The blue ones are thinner so if you aren't gentle they can tear. Overall I'd say they're fairly durable considering what they are used for. They do hydrate well and fit perfectly under the eye. I didn't have any issues with them sliding or falling off once in place. I was able to move around while it absorbed into my skin. It dries pretty quickly leaving my skin smooth and moisturized after removing. I would buy again. My eye bags are so much better now, My fark cicrles are gone and my wrinkles have significantly improved.

This stuff is super thick as well, a little goes a longgg way. It’s also such a good price. You get a lot of lotion for a fairly low cost & it’s lasted well over a month and a half without going through too much, which is really nice.

It provides noticeable 24-hour moisture that keeps my skin feeling soft and hydrated throughout the day thanks to nourishing ingredients like shea butter and oils.

Amazon,Beauty_Personal_Care,beauty products,R2JXPEE54JY9WP,My sensory savior 🙏🏿,"I think this might be my new holy grail moisturizer. Before then, I used one of those urea/aha based exfoliating lotions that despite moisturizing capabilities didn't hold up in a dry home. Enters Eos, after a browsing reddit beauty post. Why it's my HG: It's non-greasy consistency for one, absorbs fast and it leaves you soft and moisturized for hours. It's not tacky, goopy and gross which is a sensory ick to me. The scent is not in your face strong or cloying, but like buttery vanilla frosting, and it's a lasting scent for something that light. It's still on my nightgown, and I'm sure if I had a guy, he'd probably want to smell my skin every time. Lastly it's good quality for the price point, but I'm a little biased since I loved their lip balms in the little orb, I figured it couldn't hurt. It was a toss up between this and Nivea but IIRC they were about $11 vs $8 and some change for Eos 16oz. I'm indulgent, but frugal, so this won out in the end.

The size is great, I wish they would make a bigger one because I use it every day, so a bottle only lasts me about 2 weeks because I apply it head to toe, but I don't mind because it's a good deal.

At first sniff, on my skin, this smells EXACTLY like pistachio gelato tastes. Creamy, smooth, not too sweet. Then there's a faint metallic tang. It's a fragrance, overall, that I can't say I mind, but it's probably not something I would usually choose to smell like. I was expecting a less literal interpretation of ""creme de pistachio"", I guess, but it smells like what it says on the tin. And faintly, like the tin itself. It is a light fragrance, but it really hangs in there for many, many hours. I've had several people sniff this and they have all come away looking perplexed. It could be my body chemistry adding the metallic note. Scents tend to pull soapy on me, but this is a new one. Idk. I get why this is a cult favorite.

It is a bit harder to do a light coat with this wand, especially if using a pretty new bottle. It does not flake off during the day and leave scattered black flakes under eyes or face, which as you know, can be difficult to find in drug store products. The only downfall - it does seem to irritate the eyes more than other products. I wear contacts on a dialy basis. I never felt like my eyes were itchy or dry when using another brand.

Amazon,Beauty_Personal_Care,beauty products,RTF9TTO9JY673,Sky High Sensational,"I like this product well enough because of the applicator and the true brown color. The applicator allows the product to be spread evenly without clumping giving your lashes a nice, natural look. But compared to my Maybelline The Colossal Waterproof mascara, it doesn’t really give my lashes the “umph” I was hoping for. I think it’s mainly due to the color difference. The downside though with my Colossal mascara is that it smudges a lot and is a bit too waterproof, making it hard to take off even with micellar water. Because of this I’ll be using the Lash Sensational Sky High more but it is lacking a little also in my opinion.",4,Z. Hood,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2025"

Amazon,Security_Surveillance,cctv,R29JUCXMUTVYJ0,"Nice pet camera, easy set up and good value","The TP-Link Tapo camera works great as a pet camera and it’s an excellent value for the price. This camera was super easy to set up and has all the features I need to check in on my pets when I am sat work or away from home. Picture quality is good and the field of vision adequate, and with the panning feature it is easy to look into different areas of a room. You can pan side to side at least 180 degrees as well as up and down to a certain degree. The camera plus into a wall outlet so there is no concern over battery life. I have another security camera that I use in another area of the house that is rechargeable which is great for an area that isn’t close to a power outlet but you always have to worry about battery life and recharging. No concern with this one. As with other security camera you can set up alerts for motion and it has other features. One feature I like is being able to use a SD card to store pictures and videos rather than use a cloud account although you still have that option for a price. Picture quality is good, the only issue I’ve experienced is when the camera is pointed to a window which makes the picture much darker trying to adjust to the bright light.

Amazon,Security_Surveillance,cctv,R3QN5X4DDU0UUG,Cat Cam with Great Features at an Unbeatable Price,"I was looking for a second cat camera to monitor our cats when we’re away from home, with specific needs: two-way audio, local and cloud recording, motion detection with alerts, and clear video with night vision. The TP-Link Tapo Pan/Tilt Security Camera, on sale for just $19, checked all my boxes and exceeded expectations with some unexpected bonuses. Here’s my experience to help you decide if this camera is right for you. Performance and Features The 1080P video is sharp and clear, providing enough detail to see what my cats are up to, even in low light thanks to the reliable night vision. The pan/tilt feature allows me to cover a wide area of the room, and the motion detection works flawlessly, sending alerts to my phone and triggering house lights when set up. The two-way audio is a fun bonus—I tested it and startled my cats by speaking through the camera when I wasn’t in the room! My wife loves that we can share video clips easily through the app, which adds a nice touch for capturing cute moments. Setup and Integration Setup was a breeze, and I was thrilled to find that the Tapo app automatically integrated with my existing Kasa app, adding the camera to my master device list without any extra effort. It works seamlessly with both Alexa and Google Home, allowing voice commands and linking motion alerts to control smart lights in the house. I inserted a 128GB Class 10 micro-SD card for local recording, which provides up to 16 days of continuous storage, and I also set up cloud recording for added peace of mind. Both recording options work perfectly for my needs. Verdict At $19, this camera is an absolute steal for a pet or baby monitor. It delivers clear video, reliable motion detection, two-way audio, and night vision, with the added flexibility of local and cloud storage. The seamless integration with the Kasa app, Alexa, and Google Home makes it incredibly user-friendly, and the ability to share clips is a fun perk. Whether you’re keeping an eye on pets, kids, or your home, this camera offers premium features at a budget-friendly price. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a versatile, high-quality security camera. Pro Tip: Pair it with a high-capacity micro-SD card (like a 128GB Class 10) for extended local recording, and take advantage of the Alexa/Google Home integration to link motion alerts with smart home devices for added convenience.

Amazon,Security_Surveillance,cctv,R2VPSC8IQA6UQK,Easy to install. 1080p is Amazing,"This product was a great deal! We got an excellent price on it, and it arrived early. It was well packaged and everything was secure with boxes and boxes of cameras, hard-drive and wiring. Install was super easy, since we were replacing our old system. Took my husband approx 1hr and 30 mins to get all the old cameras down (4) and new cameras (5/8) installed. We were able to use the old wires to pull new wiring through. Setup was also super easy, as we have not run this through our wifi. When we go through that process, I will try to update the review with information regarding setup and app installation. Picture quality is great day and night, but the night vision is fairly limited depending on light. The scope of details for the cameras are bright to dim where there is little to no light, covering an estimated 10'W by 30'D area. In well lit areas the distance is much greater with clear picture for up to 150' or more. That is the one negative and would be the one area needing improvement, or there may be another system that offers further coverage at night. The 2T hard-drive is big but not bulky. The system we replaced was only 1T and was about 4 in more narrow from front to back. We chose this system because of the ability to hook 8 cameras up. It also has the capabilities to mix and match so we can use wireless cameras if wanted as well. Since we were going from wired to wired, with the exception of one, we chose to keep the wired cameras instead of buying all new wireless. When we get the 3 wireless I will update the review with that info if able. Setting up the system was as easy as following the prompts. Password protected or not, it is up to you. We chose to go with a wireless mouse of our own rather than use the corded mouse that is included, and it works fine like that. Easy to configure cameras and set them up. The one area that we don't like is viewing options. You can set them up with all 8 on the screen but not just 5, so we have 3 black screens where those are not connected. 1 is displayed larger than the other 7, that are all smaller around 2 sides of the 1 larger. You can also display them 1 at a time that flips from 1 to the next, and if motion occurs it will jump back to the screen and hold there for designated time. There are other options as well if you decide to do the wifi and internet option- you can set alerts to shoot an email and even contact the monitoring app for remote viewing of every alert if necessary. The motion sensitivity can be set to certain areas in a grid or for entire screen and you can have it sensitive enough to alert when a leaf falls 20 yards away during the day or less sensitivity so that it doesn't trigger further than 5ft away. The whole program is really easy to maneuver and the possibilities are endless with this system. Hopefully this review helps. I definitely recommend this product if you want good quality, excellent picture and an easy install, all for a very competitive price.",5,Patricia,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2022"

I have the Eufy indoor camera / baby monitor, but left it at home while traveling. I purchased these as a cheap backup and honestly they work just as well for about 1/3 of the price! Such a great value! These aren't 4K HD or anything, but for what they are, the quality is pretty good! (I've attached pics of day and night so you can see for yourself.) The night vision lets you see pretty clearly even in super dark spaces. I have one in an interior closet with basically zero light, and somehow it still ""sees"" just fine. The night vision is in black and white rather than color, but I’m pretty sure that's true of all night vision cameras. The sound quality is also pretty good. It's far louder than you would expect, so it picks up noise very well. The motion detection feature is also nice. You can change the sensitivity so it doesn't pick up every little rustle in the room. You can also set it to differentiate between random movement and actual humans. I have one of the Tapo stationary cameras in my cat's LitterRobot (I know that's gross, please don't judge me. My cat had a urinary blockage and almost died so now I have to make sure he uses the box at normal intervals 🫣 ) and this helps differentiate if there's a cat in the box or it it's just the robot cycling. I guess that's not the most glowing review if the camera algorithm mixes up a cat and a human... but for my purposes, I appreciate it. Mountability: I don't have my cameras mounted, so I can't tell you how easy it is personally, but I did look into the mounts when I was deciding where I wanted to put them, and they look pretty fool-proof to set up.

Amazon,Security_Surveillance,cctv,R52M2JOS2YFYB,Loooove this camera!!!!!,"Amazing camera for peace of mind. I’m a dog trainer, and have a “dog room” in my garage, and this camera was a LIFE saver! I seriously have so much more peace of mind knowing even if I leave my home, I can still see what’s going on and have a track record of everything that has happened if need be to show clients proof. It also allows others to join, so my employee can join as well and update accordingly. It’s very motion sensitive which I WANT and picks up even when the dogs are just barking and I need to go in there to see what’s going on. Amazing tool for pet owners, care takers, buisness owners, and people who just want general security in their home & want to know what’s going on and have a record of such. Disclaimer** amazing for nanny cams, pet cams, and general monitoring but it does have a monthly subscription to be able to save videos, but it’s very low & absolutely worth it to me as someone who operates a business and likes a paper trail. All in all, have had no issues with connection (and mine is in my garage!!!) so far away from the router, no issues with the app, and I’ve been extremely satirized with all that it can do for the price!

Amazon,Security_Surveillance,security camera,R16SNR0C22B4UF,Great value for the price!,"These cameras are such a great deal! They are advertised as 2k resolution, but they are much lower. However this is fine, as the quality is still great for a security camera and the smaller size realistically means less data written to your microSD card if you are using local storage. I can still see everything with great detail. The pan and tilt features work great and it has motion tracking, although I personally leave them static and focused on a single location. It comes with a mounting bracket and you can invert the camera in the app, so you can mount it upside down if you want to attach it to a ceiling. I got these mainly for use at night. The built-in infrared lighting for night vision is powerful for such a small camera. It lights up everything in frame, although I am using them indoors, so the viewing distance is no more than 30ft in the biggest room of the house. Still, I see everything clearly. It also has the option to disable IR in case you prefer color, but this will come at a cost of less detail, as the sensor may not have enough light to light everything up. You can also select a mode to have it use night vision, but diable its own infrared light, incase you are using a separate external infrared light. I don't think you would need an additional infrared light unless you were planning to use this outside and over a larger distance. Overall, really happy with these cameras for the price. They definitely give more peace of mind and make the home feel more secure. If you are planning to get these, I'd recommend ordering some microSD cards and using local storage so that you dont have to pay for cloud service. Their cloud service plans for what they offer are pricey, and aren't worth it IMO, but to others they might be.",5,KC,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2025"

Amazon,Security_Surveillance,security camera,R2T8VT15QB58P,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 5-Star Review,"We are VERY satisfied with this product. The one we have is a PERFECT nursery camera. This camera FAR surpasses the “Blink” cameras. We use it every day and it has caused us almost no issues. Occasionally it’ll disconnect from the WiFi, but it usually reconnects quickly on its own (I’ve only had to climb up to reset it once!). The reliability alone makes it worth it. We loved it so much that we purchased a second one. It’s incredibly easy to install, and the ability to share the live view with family members is a huge plus. The app is very user-friendly, and there’s no subscription needed, which feels rare these days. Image quality is clear, the controls are intuitive, and overall it just works exactly the way you want a nursery camera to work. On top of that, the customer service is fantastic—they email you after your purchase to see if you need help, and they even check in occasionally just to make sure everything is still working well. It’s refreshing to deal with a company that genuinely cares. Highly recommend!",5,Sherri,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2025"
Amazon,Security_Surveillance,security camera,RK27D7Q496FGR,Nice little camera with an added bonus - automatic tracking.,"I have set this camera up in my garage and so far, it's been working great. I especially like the live tracking feature where if the camera detects a human, it will attempt to track and follow that person around the room. At first, it seems very unreal and kind of creepy that a camera is following you, but I've gotten used to it and it's great so that you can review the footage later and follow the motion. The set up to my wireless network through the app was straight forward, very easy to connect on the first try and the connection has been strong ever since. Overall, this is an excellent camera if you're in the market for one and it also has IR so even in total darkness, you're still able to view the video.",5,Kyle ,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2025"

Easy to install and set up, no subscription required, and they have been up fivemonths without problem. The solar panels seem to charge them very effectively, only needing to charge about every three days, and you can track that through the app very easily. These have pretty much every feature you could want in a home security camera. The one feature I wish they did have ( and could probably be added later through firmware update, hint hint Eufy) is the ability to have the cameras scan an area regularly. You can set a default position and multiple additional views in the app, but have to switch between them manually. It is great that I can view recorded clips and live footage from anywhere very easily and everything is stored locally at my home with no subscription.

Amazon,Security_Surveillance,security camera,R2VPMJCXPDLCJ2,Perfect Solar-Powered Camera for Simple Home Security,"This is the second security camera I've purchased, and it's a significant upgrade! My first experience was with a Blink camera, which was a decent entry-level option, but the monthly fees were a downside. What I immediately loved about this camera is that it doesn't require any monthly subscription. I've always been intrigued by 360 cameras but wasn't sure which one to choose. When this one popped up as a Black Friday deal, I jumped at the chance, and I'm so glad I did. The installation was straightforward, with easy-to-follow instructions. It connects to Wi-Fi effortlessly, making setup a breeze. I had it professionally mounted on the side of my house, and the image quality is excellent. The audio is also clear, making it a high-quality camera overall. The fact that there's no mandatory monthly fee is a huge plus, though there's an option to upgrade if desired. Video storage is handled locally on the camera. It's important to note that motion detection recordings, such as people approaching or cars stopping by, are automatically deleted after 24 hours. While you can purchase additional storage if you need to keep videos longer, I personally find the 24-hour storage sufficient for my needs. I'm comfortable with the videos disappearing unless there's a specific recording I want to save or download. For those seeking a simple, reliable camera to monitor their front door or home, I highly recommend this one. The solar panel feature is a game-changer. No need to worry about changing batteries or complicated wiring, as it charges itself continuously.",5,Maria G.,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2025"

Amazon,Security_Surveillance,security camera,R33Z7M9RD9YXTU,Pretty Good PTZ Solar Security Cameras,"These cameras are pretty good. Good clarity, good tracking, not too sensitive or lacking sensitivity. Picks up wildlife around my property when I have animal detection turned on. Human tracking is ideal. I do recommend following the installation instructions and mount the camera(s) so they detect at an angle. Head on monitoring doesn't always pick up a person approaching the house. Easy setup and if you need a larger amount of storage, purchase the Home Base. Battery life is good. The solar panels recharge the batteries well. The only downfall I have found is that when viewing Live View, there is an annoying pop-up every couple of minutes causing you to either keep live view going or cancel live viewing. I rely heavily on live view and I monitor my battery level so I don't need a pop-up that cancels the live view if you don't choose to continue it. I have sent a suggestion to the manufacturer explaining my issue. I think (I'm no pro at how this all works) it may just be a programming change in software (app). We'll see.

You can talk through the camera to speak to intruders or your own family. Hopefully the solar works well but I need more time to find out. You cannot setup auto cloud storage and the device will delete old videos when it reaches capacity, but it has a solid built in storage capacity.

It picks up my entire kitchen, my breakfast area and my family room and even part of my dining room from one well placed location. The video is actually pretty high-quality considering the wide angle fixed lens. The night time or dark room quality is OK, but noticeably limited in field of view as the illumination is very weak.

The full trial service includes recorded video and other nice features that you will have to sign up for and pay for to continue to use.

HP support has a video on their YouTube channel of how to set it up, and it was really straight forward. After you take off the tape and plastic liners, it has you download the HP app and the app guides you through setting up the WiFi, paper, & ink. Overall from unboxing to printing my first sheet, it probably took about 15-20 minutes. Setting up my WiFi and connecting to my phone was a breeze. I don’t have a computer so I was worried about finding a printer that could easily print from my phone, but this was very simple and easy to do. I was able to print documents directly from my files, as well as photos from my photo app. It takes a little less than 30 seconds per sheet, which isn’t bad for an at home printer, but could be slightly irritating if you’re printing over 50 pages at a time. The ink is great, prints pretty true to color. The black is saturated, and the colored ink is slightly less vibrant but that’s not an issue for me personally. I added a photo of what it looks like printing via the HP app, as well as the printed page afterwards. As you can see, the black is nice and saturated, the red is slightly less saturated but nothing bad, and it prints very accurately. This is perfect for my homeschooling needs, & for less than $40 I’m very happy with it. Pros : - printer and copy machine in one - comes with ink both black and colored - black ink is nice and saturated - an additional 3 month free trial to their ink subscription - after the trial the ink subscription isn’t very expensive either which is great. - 1 year warranty included - affordable printer (bought on sale for $35) - set up took less than 20 minutes start to finish - prints fast enough for at home use - can print straight from my phone, either from files or photo library Cons : - colored ink is slightly dull, but not too bad as long as you’re not printing actual photos. - the print speed could be an issue for you if you’re printing over 50 pages at a time",5,jay,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2025"

The ink supply that was included is holding up well even after extensive use and the cartridges were easy to install.

The print quality is not the best but acceptable for my purposes. The paper tray feels solid and doesn’t jam. I plan to download the HP Smart App soon. The product exceeded my expectations in terms of quality. It was well packaged, durable, the design both functional, space saving and attractive. At a price of just $38.89, this Amazon limited time deal offered exceptional value compared to similar products. It arrived in great condition and on time.

Amazon,Office_Printer_Supplies,printer,R19SSRW1M9IDIN,Solid All-in-One Printer with Great Wireless Features,"I've been using the HP DeskJet 2827e for about two months now, and overall, I'm quite satisfied with this printer. The setup process was straightforward - I had it connected to my WiFi and printing from my phone within 15 minutes. The wireless printing capability is excellent. I can easily print from multiple devices including my laptop, tablet, and smartphone without any connection issues. The HP Smart app makes it simple to manage print jobs, check ink levels, and even scan documents directly to my phone. Print quality is solid for everyday documents and casual photo printing. Text comes out crisp and clear, and colors are reasonably accurate for home use. The scanner works well too, producing clean scans suitable for digital archiving and email attachments. However, there are a couple of drawbacks worth mentioning. First, the printing speed is somewhat slow compared to higher-end models - it's not a problem for occasional printing but could be frustrating if you're printing large documents regularly. Second, like most inkjet printers, the ink cartridges don't last as long as I'd hoped, especially if you print in color frequently. The HP Instant Ink subscription helps manage costs, but it's an additional ongoing expense. Despite these minor issues, this printer offers great value for home users who need basic printing, scanning, and copying capabilities with wireless convenience. It's compact, relatively quiet, and does exactly what most people need without breaking the bank.",4,andrew,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2025"

Amazon,Networking_Devices,router,R2WQ8XV571CXWV,It works and is secure!,"I wanted a more secure WiFi router while also saving money on the rental from my cable provider, so I was suggested to purchase this by a very experienced tech and cyber security wiz. Now, I personally don't feel that I know much about anything technical these days, but I have really enjoyed this so far. Performance wise, but more than anything I REALLY love the security of the back-office type of controls the TP-Link gives you. PERFORMANCE Now, my current home is 1500 sq ft and a split level home, so most of the areas I use WiFi at home are never too far from the router. I placed the router right on the TV stand underneath the TV so that certainly is as close as it gets. When I'm upstairs (technically 1.5 levels up from the router) I still seem to get fine enough WiFi when I'm browsing on my phone. I will say that the WiFi randomly cuts out for me, but, this is definitely an issue I had with my previous equipment so I don't blame the router itself, it is my provider. Or the wiring outside my house.. not really sure. I have noticed however that when the service does go out, ever since changing to the TP-Link, the service returns much faster and I never have to reset it. With my old provider-provided router, it would be out for hours and I always seemed to have to manually reset the equipment. So in summary, the service and performance for me has been exemplary! SOFTWARE The primary reason I got this was to make sure nobody could hack into my WiFi. With other routers, I am not sure if the same service is available, but this was the first I've ever seen it. Yes... we all know that WiFi is password protected. BUT. Someone can easily hack into it, right? Well not with the TP-Link! You can access the router security through the routers IP address, and you set a password for that as well. The user interface is pretty simple for even a dolt like myself to understand. You can control who can access your WiFi by using a blacklist or a whitelist. A blacklist means that all who have the login details *except* for specific IP addresses you've blocked can access. A whitelist means that ONLY the IP addresses you have added to your list can access the WiFi. I am using the whitelist, since I do not want anyone random or unwanted accessing my service. Let me tell you, it works perfectly! Sometimes I forget that I have this setup, and I have tried many times with many different devices to try and access the wifi... heck, even the guest network, that I thought was specifically setup for this, doesn't seem to let random users access it. It also shows you who is currently accessing it, although I find that feature doesn't seem to be totally accurate sometimes. I give the software 5 stars for the simple fact that it is so easy to control access through it. SUMMARY Overall I am very happy with this purchase. It does what I want it to do, very securely. Setup was a little confusing because if I recall correctly, nobody could access it until we were able to get into the back-office software and setup password first. Other than that I really have had no issues and enjoy using it. When I need to change a setting it is super easy to get in and make any adjustments.",5,UAstudentn,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2022"
Amazon,Networking_Devices,router,R2L2PHG4W1FXBK,Reliable WiFi 6 performance with real improvements across the whole house.,"The TP-Link AX1800 WiFi 6 Router has been a noticeable upgrade in my home network, and everything here comes from my own experience using it in a fairly device-heavy household. I upgraded from an older WiFi 5 router that had started to struggle, and the improvement with the AX21 has been clear from day one. Setup was simple, but what I liked most was how much control the interface gives without feeling overwhelming. I used the browser setup and adjusted dual-band settings, enabled WPA3, and optimized the channel width in just a few minutes. The interface responds quickly, and making changes does not require constant rebooting or digging through hidden menus. The performance difference with WiFi 6 has been significant. I have multiple smart TVs, computers, phones, and IoT devices, and my previous router would slow down when several things were active at once. The AX21 handles everything smoothly. OFDMA and MU-MIMO keep the network stable even during heavy loads. I’ve streamed 4K content, joined online meetings, and transferred large files all at the same time without interruptions. Coverage has also improved. I tested it with the WiFi Analyzer app for Android, which I’ve used for years to check signal strength and network congestion. In areas where the old router consistently dipped, the AX21 delivered noticeably stronger and more stable readings. In actual use, this translates to fewer drops, steadier speeds, and better performance when moving between rooms. Beamforming makes a difference, especially with mobile devices. The wired connections are equally reliable. I connected my desktop and game console using the gigabit Ethernet ports and ran sustained transfers from a NAS. Speeds stayed at full gigabit with no fluctuations, and the router stayed cool throughout heavy use. Another thing I appreciate is how quietly and efficiently the router runs. It doesn’t heat up, even when multiple devices are streaming and downloading simultaneously, which says a lot about its hardware design. Based on my experience, the TP-Link AX1800 WiFi 6 Router offers a great balance of real-world performance, strong coverage, and easy configuration. It provides the benefits of WiFi 6 without the overwhelming complexity some high-end models add. For anyone looking for a reliable and technically capable upgrade, this router has been a very solid choice in my home.",5,Kambuko,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2025"
Amazon,Networking_Devices,router,R2SYE1J3KXB7AD,Tp-Link AXE5400,"I really regret not buying this TP-Link AXE5400 Wi-Fi 6E router earlier. The router from my internet provider only had two bands and a limited number of connected devices, which constantly caused issues. After switching to this router, those problems are completely gone. Now all my devices — and I have a lot of them — work perfectly stable with no random disconnects. I really love the tri-band setup. Smart home devices like cameras and robot vacuums run on the 2.4 GHz band, TVs, PlayStation, and gaming consoles use 5 GHz, and phones and laptops connect to the ultra-fast 6 GHz band. Everything is perfectly balanced and smooth. Setup was fast and easy, coverage is excellent throughout the house, and speeds are impressive on every band. Streaming, gaming, and working online all happen at the same time with zero lag or interruptions. This router has completely upgraded my home network. It’s powerful, reliable, and absolutely worth it.

After purchasing another a Netgear Mesh router system (and having nothing but constant connectivity issues), I returned that one. I did more research and ended up getting the TP-Link AXE5400. I had the best luck setting it up using the PC/Ethernet connection vs. the Tether phone APP that gave me trouble. The Admin via PC worked slick and I was quickly able to set up my network name & password and automatic firmware upgrades quickly. The router has been in-service for a week with no connectivity issues and great coverage throughout the house and out in the garage (where I couldn't get Wi-Fi with my old router).

Amazon,Networking_Devices,router,R9Y2I4ZDQ9Y8K,Love it! Love it!🥰,"We have lived in my house for over 10 years. It’s an older house built in the 60s, There are 6 of us in the house 4 adults, one 13y and one 7y. We have 3 ring devices, 4 Alexa’s, 6 fire sticks, 6 computers, 6 gaming consoles, a generator, and we all have iPads, cell phones etc, so there are a lot of devices connected to our wifi, so we’ve never had great luck with the range or performance of our internet signal. Things would buffer alot or we’d have dropped signals, so I was always restarting the router. We use to have Brighthouse but currently have Spectrum with just internet, We upgraded our internet to 1GB over a year ago and was given a dual band wifi 5 router that never really worked for us perfectly, I believe it was because it couldn’t support 1GB, but didn’t know that until I got this router. We were using an extender so we could connect to our generator and ring camera that was located outside, and just so you can have an idea, on our generator the wifi signal was at 2%, which was fine but if we wanted to connect anything else outside it was almost impossible. So we contacted customer support about the issues we were having, and they sent us there newest router the wifi 6e router, mind you we were still using the extender. It worked good for a couple days then it stopped. A lot of buffering and a lot of devices wouldn’t even connect to it like my Oculus Quest 2, my husbands work computer and more! I couldn’t even connect our ring camera outback, and the generator outside was getting 0%-1% signal, so the signal would drop a lot. I figured it was because a lot of things still aren’t compatible with wifi 6. So we called support again they did manage to get everything working for about 5 days, then it would stop again. So we called support for the last time and they told us to try to buy a router ourselves. So I happened to come across this one. I was pretty skeptical, thinking it may work as well as the dual band one we had only maybe a little better. The setup process was so easy! Didn’t have to call Spectrum at all! I do wish that the parental controls, security+ and, QoS was free. But they do give you a free month with any of them. So I did the security+. The app you use with it is great! There are a lot of tools in the settings. You can have it auto connect to a network or set it up separately so you can choose 2.4, 5 or 6G, which is what I did. You can have a guest network, optimize your network performance and a lot more! Everything connected perfectly with excellent signal! So I figured I would try to connect the generator and ring camera outback without the extender just for kicks, since I was feeling optimistic😎 The ring camera connected perfectly with excellent signal! Now was the most important test, the generator😵‍💫 Connected it for the first time and I see 22% signal!!! I was SOOO excited! Then I went to the farthest part of my backyard with my cell phone where Iv never had wifi signal before and I had 3-4 bars of wifi signal!!! I couldn’t believe it! This thing has GREAT range, GREAT performance, and is easy to set up and use, what else could you want! It’s been a couple weeks now, no buffering! and everything works flawlessly! I couldn’t be happier! No one complaining for me to fix the wifi anymore and no restarting it twice a week! I would definitely recommend this to anyone that has horrible or just ok wifi signal. The only flaw I can say about it is needing a subscription for the extras. Otherwise just go for it!

Amazon,Networking_Devices,router,R212GSPJGDJEDT,Works great,"I've never used a router before, so I was honestly a little overwhelmed by all the parts and pieces that come with this. It looked like there was a lot to learn. But after reading through the manual and finding a random 5-minute YouTube video on how to use a router, I got the basics and went ahead and tried it out. And? I think it's great! I was doing tests on a nasty old 2x4, so don't judge the prettiness (or lack thereof) of the work in my photos. Considering it was my first time ever using a router, though, I'm impressed with how well it worked out (and how cleanly it cut). I tried out the round-over bit, going deep to round the edge while leaving a shoulder. And I tried one of the straight bits to plunge in and cut a straight groove. I found the router to be powerful, simple to handle and overall easier to use than I expected. You just pop in your bit, use the 2 wrenches to tighten the collet, adjust your depth and you're good to go (or add the guide first for more precision). My only nitpick is that I think the straight guide could be better. The screw and wing nut that you use to set your distance isn't all the great. But at this price, I'm not complaining.

Amazon,Networking_Devices,router,R12GO0K22ZO8HN,Nice fixed base budge palm router kit,"This palm router is better quality than I expected and comes with guides and 6 common router bits making it essentially a ready to use kit. The router bits appear to be more budge quality than higher end bits, but they should work fine for casual use but likely will dull quickly. I unfortunately injured myself so I cannot give them much testing at this time. The bits do come with plastic storage containers that are great for protecting the bit blades from being damaged in storage and will be useful for future replacement bits. There are some features missing that more expensive palm routers will have like variable speed and soft start. Being at full speed, make sure any bits you purchase are rated for at least 35000 rpm. The motor feels like it has plenty of power to handle harder woods or even moderate size bits. This is a fixed depth with the depth adjustment having a metal gear that rides along molded teeth in the plastic body of the router. This may wear faster than if it was metal on metal, but with extra care it shouldn’t be a real issue anytime soon. This router will come in handy for those uses where getting out my full size router is too much work or when it’s on my router table. Overall for a casual DIYer or someone just starting to build their shop this is a great value that I hope will last for a long time.

Amazon,Networking_Devices,router,R3CZJ75EQFXY9A,Ease of Installation for those that are clueless to network connectivity.,"25 years ago, I installed server systems, terminals, printers, and network routers. All that networking equipment had to be set up with laptops directly connected to the routers' ports. Nothing was autosensing. I enjoyed it, but I knew what I was doing. Fast forward to today. I had to replace my own 25-year-old router because new laptops would not connect to it due to upgraded security software. I thought, Oh boy. I bet this is going to be a trip. I had forgotten most of what I knew; besides, I knew nothing about this new stuff. I picked this TP-Link AC1200. It was inexpensive, but we didn't need anything robust since we are not gamers. First of all, I ordered it on Amazon at about 3 pm. 8:30 pm, a car backs into my driveway. They delivered the router in less than 6 hours. Incredible! Today I went to install it. I was expecting a bit of a hassle with configuring this thing. After physically connecting the two cables —the power cord and the network cable —I powered it on. I went to my PC. The TP-Link showed up in my available networks. I click on it. Put in the password supplied. Got connected, but I had no internet connectivity. Ahh! I had to disconnect a cable from my MAIN in-house router, then reconnect it so that the router ID would be discovered. I went back out to the shop, clicked on Safari (I have an Apple MacBook). Wala, I'm IN. I could NOT believe how easy the installation went. No glitches, smooth operation, and my network is all updated. I know how networking operates, but I am clueless about all the newer equipment since I've been out of the field for almost 15 years. So, even a stupid person like me can set up this equipment that used to take a lot of training 25 years ago. This inexpensive wireless router is absolutely outstanding. I usually do not write such long reviews, but I could not let this pass without adding my thoughts about the TP-Link AC1200 WiFi Router.

It is still working perfectly for us and we have zero complaints. I highly recommend it! We moved to the middle of nowhere about 7 years ago and it never occurred to us to check who provided TV/internet/phone at the new house before buying. We found out after buying the house that the only providers were satellite companies. We realized very quickly that first year that satellite sucks, the internet specifically. We got locked into a $75 a month plan with HughesNet for a year and never once were able to actually use the internet that whole year. It was really frustrating. We simply did not have home internet for the past 6 years due to a lack of a decent provider. This past week Spectrum finally moved their service to our road. We immediately signed up. I knew I wasn't paying them $5 a month to rent a router from them but I also wasn't sure at all how to pick out a router myself. I've always been pretty tech savvy but when you lose access(and a need) to those things you stop keeping up with them, I was seriously behind on all the new updates that have been made over the last several years. I knew I didn't want to spend more than $50 on a router and after doing some research I finally decided on this TP-Link AC1200 and basically just hoped for the best. Some of the reviews weren't great so I was nervous. It arrived a day after our internet was installed so I set it up by myself. It took me all of 20 mins from unboxing to the whole house having Wi-Fi, it was VERY easy. I love that it has it's own app, a very convenient feature. We live in a 2000sq. ft., one floor, manufactured home. These homes have pretty thin walls so the signal reaches from one end to the other very easily. We are also extremely heavy on our data usage in this family and while it's only been a couple of days now it has had zero trouble keeping up with us. We've had zero buffering while streaming & using our phones, everything has been working very quickly. We have several smart TVs, cell phones, a laptop, a printer & a PS4 connected to it at the moment. The technician from Spectrum who installed our internet also said this was a good option for our 200mbps plan. I hope this helps someone make up their mind on whether this router will be a good choice for them.

The setup process was surprisingly easy; I followed the instructions included in the box, and I was online within 20 minutes. The modem is compatible with most major ISPs, making it a versatile choice for different users. Performance: Where the CAX modem truly shines is in its performance. With my previous modem, I often encountered buffering issues and dropped connections during high usage times and packet loss. However, since switching to the CAX, I’ve experienced significantly faster speeds, particularly when streaming 4K content or gaming online. The modem supports DOCSIS 3.1, which allows for lightning-fast download speeds, and I can confidently say it lives up to its promises. Connectivity: The CAX modem features multiple Ethernet ports, which is a fantastic addition for anyone with multiple wired devices. The Wi-Fi range is impressive as well; I’ve noticed a stable connection even in rooms that previously had weak signals. This feature has been extremely beneficial for my family, enabling seamless browsing and streaming on multiple devices without any lag. Value for Money: With its robust performance and modern features, the CAX modem is reasonably priced, especially considering the cost savings on rental fees from ISPs. If you’re a heavy internet user, investing in a quality modem like this can lead to significant long-term savings. Conclusion: Overall, the CAX modem has exceeded my expectations. Its design is user-friendly, setup is a breeze, and its performance is flawless. For anyone looking to enhance their home network experience, the CAX modem is certainly worth considering.",5,Peter H,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2025"

It sets up quickly, handles typical streaming and work needs well, and offers enough wired ports to keep key devices stable. I’ve also seen its limits: some users run into occasional Wi-Fi drops, slower-than-expected speeds, or gaming latency unless they use a wired connection.

Amazon,Networking_Devices,wifi modem,R1GU88Y83CJSLZ,Simple setup with Netgear app/Strong coverage,"Bought this NETGEAR Nighthawk to avoid paying Spectrum for a router. If you're a Spectrum customer, this router works with the Spectrum modem. It arrived this morning and after 20 minutes it's up and running. We live in a one floor, 1500 square foot condo. Coverage is excellent throughout on 10 devices. The router is also small and fits nicely on our bedroom dresser. What I'm most impressed with is the setup and NETGEAR app. Download the NETGEAR app to your phone using a QR code provided on the instruction sheet. After establishing a NETGEAR account follow the prompts. This initial setup tutorial is fairly boiler plate, what sets this app apart is how it responds to issues. For example, if your router fails to connect on the first attempt, as mine did, it tells you precisely which settings to change on your phone to correct the issue. And these settings changes solved the problem in all three cases that occurred during my set up. I've never experienced this level of intuitive app support. I won't pretend to offer any review of the technical capabilities of the router, definitely outside my bandwidth, but if you're like me, comfortable with using technology, but needing guidance to navigate setups, this is a great product. The phone app is also easy to navigate and relatively self explanatory. To demonstrate, I ran a speed test from the phone app. It's way easier than using the settings function on your device. Download speed is 113.72 Mbps, Upload is 12.07 Mbps and Ping is 15.0 Ms. Do I fully understand what these mean, no, but with a small amount of research I could if issues arise. Bottom line, I'm so happy this product was easy to setup and am very pleased with the value. For a few months rental cost on my Spectrum Router, I avoid paying a lifetime monthly fee. I will leave it to others to debate the merits of the technical functions of this router.

Amazon,Networking_Devices,wifi modem,R2J7QAYEHB1IAT,Not working - factory reset made it worse,"I bought this router as a recommendation of my ISP for our city's new Fiber. It is rated over 1 GB, which is what I'm getting from the city's link. I have an ISP who I highly recommend, and they helped me troubleshoot it as far as they could, and the result is, the fiber is up (I tested it by removing the router from the network and plugging my laptop directly into the city/ISP's device, and everything popped back to life.) The jury is not still out on this one. I can't recommend it to anyone. I go back to work tomorrow, and don't have internet in my home office. Neither does my wife. I'll have to run to Best Buy (Worst Experience Ever), or Walmart (they know nothing about anything), and pick something up that WILL work. I don't trust the things Amazon has been doing, so am not sure that I'll get anything back on this purchase. That's just under $100.oo wasted for a product that lasted almost exactly 6 weeks. I used to trust Netgear. It's been a while since I bought anything of theirs. Not since I stopped being an I.T. Director and don't need to purchase equipment for a company. But, my customers now are places everyone's heard of, like Vanderbilt U., the U.S. Senate, the House or Reps; Apple, Oracle, Facebook. You know, tiny companies... I'm not a happy camper. It's Sunday late, and nothing's open, and it sucks to be me. Oh wait, Walmart is open, and I got a TP Link Wi-Fi 6 router. It works fine, as long as I have Smart Connect turned on. With that off, the link is flaky. I tried that with the Netgear router, but it made very little difference. So, to date (it's been several days since writing the above), I was told by Amazon that I had to go to Netgear for help. They will require going through the standard troubleshooting steps, so I'll have to take my internet down and plug this thing back in, then a Netgear engineer will access the router and check stuff out... I may get a new one out of this, and I'll be okay with that. No such luck. I reset it and it stayed up a couple of weeks, but now is completely dead. I'm never buying Netgear again.

Amazon,Networking_Devices,wifi modem,R2WQ8XV571CXWV,It works and is secure!,"I wanted a more secure WiFi router while also saving money on the rental from my cable provider, so I was suggested to purchase this by a very experienced tech and cyber security wiz. Now, I personally don't feel that I know much about anything technical these days, but I have really enjoyed this so far. Performance wise, but more than anything I REALLY love the security of the back-office type of controls the TP-Link gives you. PERFORMANCE Now, my current home is 1500 sq ft and a split level home, so most of the areas I use WiFi at home are never too far from the router. I placed the router right on the TV stand underneath the TV so that certainly is as close as it gets. When I'm upstairs (technically 1.5 levels up from the router) I still seem to get fine enough WiFi when I'm browsing on my phone. I will say that the WiFi randomly cuts out for me, but, this is definitely an issue I had with my previous equipment so I don't blame the router itself, it is my provider. Or the wiring outside my house.. not really sure. I have noticed however that when the service does go out, ever since changing to the TP-Link, the service returns much faster and I never have to reset it. With my old provider-provided router, it would be out for hours and I always seemed to have to manually reset the equipment. So in summary, the service and performance for me has been exemplary! SOFTWARE The primary reason I got this was to make sure nobody could hack into my WiFi. With other routers, I am not sure if the same service is available, but this was the first I've ever seen it. Yes... we all know that WiFi is password protected. BUT. Someone can easily hack into it, right? Well not with the TP-Link! You can access the router security through the routers IP address, and you set a password for that as well. The user interface is pretty simple for even a dolt like myself to understand. You can control who can access your WiFi by using a blacklist or a whitelist. A blacklist means that all who have the login details *except* for specific IP addresses you've blocked can access. A whitelist means that ONLY the IP addresses you have added to your list can access the WiFi. I am using the whitelist, since I do not want anyone random or unwanted accessing my service. Let me tell you, it works perfectly! Sometimes I forget that I have this setup, and I have tried many times with many different devices to try and access the wifi... heck, even the guest network, that I thought was specifically setup for this, doesn't seem to let random users access it. It also shows you who is currently accessing it, although I find that feature doesn't seem to be totally accurate sometimes. I give the software 5 stars for the simple fact that it is so easy to control access through it. SUMMARY Overall I am very happy with this purchase. It does what I want it to do, very securely. Setup was a little confusing because if I recall correctly, nobody could access it until we were able to get into the back-office software and setup password first. Other than that I really have had no issues and enjoy using it. When I need to change a setting it is super easy to get in and make any adjustments.",5,UAstudentn,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2022"
Amazon,Networking_Devices,wifi modem,R2L2PHG4W1FXBK,Reliable WiFi 6 performance with real improvements across the whole house.,"The TP-Link AX1800 WiFi 6 Router has been a noticeable upgrade in my home network, and everything here comes from my own experience using it in a fairly device-heavy household. I upgraded from an older WiFi 5 router that had started to struggle, and the improvement with the AX21 has been clear from day one. Setup was simple, but what I liked most was how much control the interface gives without feeling overwhelming. I used the browser setup and adjusted dual-band settings, enabled WPA3, and optimized the channel width in just a few minutes. The interface responds quickly, and making changes does not require constant rebooting or digging through hidden menus. The performance difference with WiFi 6 has been significant. I have multiple smart TVs, computers, phones, and IoT devices, and my previous router would slow down when several things were active at once. The AX21 handles everything smoothly. OFDMA and MU-MIMO keep the network stable even during heavy loads. I’ve streamed 4K content, joined online meetings, and transferred large files all at the same time without interruptions. Coverage has also improved. I tested it with the WiFi Analyzer app for Android, which I’ve used for years to check signal strength and network congestion. In areas where the old router consistently dipped, the AX21 delivered noticeably stronger and more stable readings. In actual use, this translates to fewer drops, steadier speeds, and better performance when moving between rooms. Beamforming makes a difference, especially with mobile devices. The wired connections are equally reliable. I connected my desktop and game console using the gigabit Ethernet ports and ran sustained transfers from a NAS. Speeds stayed at full gigabit with no fluctuations, and the router stayed cool throughout heavy use. Another thing I appreciate is how quietly and efficiently the router runs. It doesn’t heat up, even when multiple devices are streaming and downloading simultaneously, which says a lot about its hardware design. Based on my experience, the TP-Link AX1800 WiFi 6 Router offers a great balance of real-world performance, strong coverage, and easy configuration. It provides the benefits of WiFi 6 without the overwhelming complexity some high-end models add. For anyone looking for a reliable and technically capable upgrade, this router has been a very solid choice in my home.",5,Kambuko,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2025"
Amazon,Networking_Devices,wifi modem,R2ZP9M7J9RKUSF,Worked great for 58 days - then it didn't - Thanks Comcast,"UPDATE 3 ************** You can read my sad tale below if you choose. But a quick summary may suffice. I got the SB8200 and it worked for 58 days. It then stopped working. It was replaced by Arris but the second modem did not work, either. That modem was replaced by Arris and the third modem did not work. The odds of getting three bad modems were pretty near zero so attention turned to Comcast. A tech came out and confirmed that the SNR was way low and the signal levels were out of bounds. He ran a new cable to the Comcast distribution box and installed a new splitter. The third modem connected immediately and worked perfectly. The fact that my old modem (not a docsis 3.1) worked had initially suggested that the problem was the new modem instead of the Comcast line. Arris support was GREAT through all this. I got right through to a live tech after about 3-5 rings (after their voice menu system answered and directed my call). They replaced the modems quickly (I had to send old modem back via ground - free return shipping - but they sent replacement modem via next day delivery). This is some of the best support of any company I deal with. It is pretty much the opposite of Comcast where getting to a live agent can be very difficult. This review was originally a 2 star but is now a 5 star - and I would give Arris support 6 stars if I could. ORIGINAL POST ********************* I have had this modem for 58 days. It was working well connected to Xfinity. Good download speed. Then, today it became intermittent. It ran for a couple of minutes, then lost internet connection, then was back but at slower download speed. Then it was running fine. That pattern continued to repeat. I had hoped it was an Xfinity issue, but I reconnected my previous modem and everything is working just fine. Before purchase I had read the bad reviews, but there were way more good reviews so I hoped that I would be one of those customers that got a ""good one"". Nope. Besides EVERY modem I looked at had about the same number of bad reviews. Many saying - don't buy this. So what is one to do? UPDATE ************** I contacted Arris customer support. I got through to a tech IMMEDIATELY. He said they needed to check the modem while it was online. Since I had already installed by backup modem, I had to contact Comcast and switch my MAC address back to the Arris and get in connected. I then called Arris back and again was connected to a tech, immediately. The reason this is a 2 star rather than a 1 star is because of the ease of contacting support. The tech looked at the modem stats and agreed it was bad. After a 5 minute delay while he consulted with a supervisor, he approved my return of the modem. He emailed me a prepaid shipping label and said they would send a new modem to me as soon as they received the old one back. So what Arris may lack in quality, they do mostly make up for in good customer support. Realistically, any product can fail, so the experience in dealing with a failed product is an important part of the buying process. Arris support gets 4 stars from me - one star off for making me reinstall the modem so they can verify it was bad. Though that was a perfectly reasonable request from them, I had pretty good evidence of my assertion that it was their modem which was the issue. Update 2 ********** I got the replacement modem. I spent about 90 minutes on the phone with Xfinity and Arris customer support trying to get that modem working with Xfinity. We could not get the modem to work - it seemed like it was working for a few seconds here and there. So I am sending this replacement back and will get yet another replacement (for the replacement).

It is very easy to hook up, with a power cord, incoming comm cable, and then whatever you decide to add for direct connections. The automation within this hardware is the most advanced that we've experienced. This will auto reset, and do a number of different steps (many which are beyond my comprehension) to ensure the connection is solid and to maintain accessibility. In testing the other wifi signals in our area, there is no interference or competing signals at the WiFi 7 range. Even for the lower ranges, the G54 is excellent about placing our signal in low use channel.

Little did I know that problems would gradually start to increase with the Arris Surfboard SB8200, and seems to be an unfortunate pattern I have found with Arris Brand Cable Modems and Gateways. Customer Support is lacking and avoids addressing the issue while frequently diverting from the main problem they are asked to assist with. Arris brand products I have experienced continue to demonstrate noticeable defects and appear to be made with poor quality parts. I have purchased the Arris SB8200, SGB8300, SB6190 and SB6183 Cable Modems and Gateways and this is particularly if you have Cox Communications for an ISP, it is wise to reconsider this brand if you want a reliable internet connection and service. I strongly suggest you steer clear from this brand! The SBG8300, SB6183 and SB6190 all exhibited problems from the start, but this Surfboard SB8200 was particularly deceiving, since on the surface it seems that it would be a top performing product being DOCSIS 3.1 and not made with the Puma 6 Chipset some of us had the misfortune of experiencing defects with. I have now found this SB8200 device to be useless after 6 months and hours and hours troubleshooting with Arris customer support via chat, phone and email. You will be out of options when this product starts to fail, which for me is outside the return time frame with Amazon and Arris will refuse to take any type of accountability or responsibility for this failing product. The numbers of issues faced with this defective product has been extremely frustrating and caution a prospective buyer of this DOCSIS 3.1 modem to reconsider. Do yourself a favor, choose another brand Modem or Gateway. Anything with this brand made within the last 5 years I have noticed lacks basic performance and will begin to exhibit these issues and defects no later than 6 months into operation. I suspected it was my Internet Service Provider or Router that was the problem at first when I began to have increased and unexpected as well as unexplained internet outages. Knowing Cox had a history of preferring Arris brand equipment, I never suspected I would encounter problems with their products. After I could not ignore the unexplained connection drops and unusual amount of internet outages I finally uncovered this cable modem was the culprit, however was too late to recover the investment. It wasn't until a Cox technician noticed the unusually slow and odd way this modem rebooted after a connection drop and told me he had nothing but problems with this brand of equipment he never encountered with the others. I began to look into the problems with this product, and started to see a noticeable pattern of dissatisfaction from customers like myself. I have replaced this cable modem now with the Motorola MB8600 and had success with the modem and absolutely no issues since purchasing it. The MB8600 worked right out of the box, which I cannot speak for it down the road, but already seems more promising that any of the Arris brand products I have unfortunately purchased in the past. I thought I would provide a review on this product as I am able to speak now to the longevity of this Arris Cable Modem model SB8200 and a few other Arris products that failed prior to this one. This investment I made was a big mistake so hopefully this can help you make an informed decision which I strongly caution you all with purchasing this product.",1,AZDesertMonsoons89,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2022"
Amazon,Networking_Devices,wifi modem,R1XTHNYPM3OA1,Best mid-range value modem,"So I've had this modem for a few weeks. I used to have a Motorola Surfboard 6141 I believe (going off memory). That modem at times would randomly drop speeds down to 1mb/s maximum for no reason, then throttle back up. I tried to research this and found out it might have been related to the Time Warner Maxx internet package I have (I'm grandfathered into a package that currently doesn't exist). No idea how or why that would matter but it seems to be the reason why my old Surfboard was having problems. So a deal hit and I dropped cash for this modem in hopes I could solve this problem fairly cheaply and so far its working. I haven't noticed any lag, no strange behavior like dropping to 1mb/s speeds, its been consistent and constant fast speeds, even above the stated speeds I should receive. The unit is well ventilated so the concern of heating up is not an issue. It's barely warm to the touch. I think as others have stated, if you put this in a confined space, for example an entertainment center with a glass door, then it'll heat up more than likely because there's no internal fan. But if you provide adequate air circulation then it'll function perfectly from my point of view. Also I wasn't able to successfully hook up the unit and remotely update to Time Warner that I am switching modems (Mac address) so I had to call them.

Gotta be right up on it dang near to get connected. I have it running with an even more horrible Tenda router. I even bought a WiFi booster and still no reach. And it’s tiny as heck. Over half the size lesser than my rental modem. I think I wanna keep paying the fees and return this. Update: March 20, 2023: I am changing my review from 1 star to 4 stars. If you need a modem, that you plan on using a router with, this could work. My COX internet service started going in and out. Tried troubleshooting the matter. Cox says they need to charge a technician out to my house. $75 to have someone come fix the very internet I am paying for. So I told them let me think about. ( that’s like paying for a medium steak, getting well done, and they charge you to have a chef come out and remake the very steak you paid for but aren’t getting) so I just Pulled this bad boy out of hiding, blew the dust off and reactivated it. Had a separate Cox rep swap the modem out. She did not try to charge me a tech. She was very nice and fast. And now I’m interneted up again lol. The difference now is, instead of that sorry, sorry excuse of a router by tenda, I’m using the very GREAT Rockspace Mesh 3 box set extender system. And I couldn’t be happier. The thing about this modem is it’s only one output. You could plug your cpu directly, or use a mesh. The mesh is the best bet. In the past, I had to get a larger data plan, (over $100/mo) bc the internet sucked. Cox upsold my plan. But check your equipment before letting ppl charge you. Now, I have a more basic plan, so I’m paying less, and still able to use all my devices just the same. And the netgear has stepped in place of the very heavy duty Panoramic Gateway equipment they give you. And so far, it is working exceptionally . So I actually would recommend this modem, paired with Rockspace Mesh system. And you got yourself some connectivity to knock your socks off. Very impressed. Btw: it was a little difficult to pair, bc I used it prior, so I had to reset both the netgear and Rockspace with their reset buttons to have the names revert back to the original SSID.

Amazon,Networking_Devices,wifi modem,RROX9QFCKFI84,"Dead after 2 months - WORST customer support ever, TERRIBLE warranty coverage","This modem worked fine for a couple months. Occasional disconnects, but not frequent. Then just over a week ago it started disconnecting frequently (like several times an hour) and for several minutes at a time, even for up to 10 minutes at a time. Called their tech support (over ONE HOUR on hold just waiting for someone) and they said the problem is with my ISP (Cox). So I call them and they send out a tech. In the meantime I have to wait about a week for my ISP tech to come out, in the meantime the signal dropping gets worse and worse (like for 15-30 minutes at a time, sometimes over an hour, and happening super frequently, like basically the internet signal only lasting for 5-15 minutes at a time). Thankfully when Cox came out they didn't charge me, but they found NO problems on the line, verified it with their equipment at each point. They added a power dropper anyway to make sure. The modem got worse for the next couple days, to the point where it basically won't connect at all, and instead just keeps restarting itself looking for a signal (that it can't process). So I call Netgear tech support back for a replacement, this time TWO HOURS on hold. Finally they walk me through the same stupid steps (reset the modem, etc.), and then they say the fact that it can't connect to the internet means it's a problem with my ISP, saying they weren't configured for my modem (even though they obviously were because it worked fine for two months with no changes). Ridiculous answer - they have NO IDEA how to troubleshoot their modems, just find ways to blame it on the ISP. After getting irate for a LONG time and they finally agreed to authorize a return (RMA). Turns out if you PAY to ship it back to them, they'll eventually send you a new one (with slow shipping).

Amazon,Toys_Kids,kids toys,R1Q0B2F222HECF,The perfect LEGO starter kit!!,"As a parent, I can wholeheartedly recommend this LEGO set. This set is absolutely fantastic and truly lives up to the ""Classic"" name by providing an incredible foundation for endless creativity. What I Loved: • Exceptional Value: Getting this many bricks, along with the handy storage box, for the price is an incredible deal. It offers hours of engagement for a minimal investment. • The Perfect Starter Set: If your child (or you!) is new to LEGO, this is the perfect place to start. It contains a wonderful variety of basic bricks in all shapes and colors, making it easy to build anything you can imagine. • Encourages Imagination: The included instructions for the train, car, and tiger are great jumping-off points, but the real fun is when my kids start creating their own structures and figures. The open-ended nature of this set truly fosters imagination. • Great Color and Brick Variety: The mix of bright, vibrant colors and the assortment of different specialty pieces (like eyes, wheels, and window frames) is well-curated. This allows for detailed and interesting builds beyond simple square houses. • Handy Storage Box: The iconic yellow storage box is a huge bonus! It's sturdy, keeps all the bricks tidy, and makes clean-up so much easier. Minor Considerations: • This is a ""Classic"" set, so don't expect highly specific themed pieces. Its strength is in the basic building blocks, which is exactly what we wanted! Conclusion: This set is an absolute staple for any toy collection. It's high-quality, promotes imaginative and fine motor skills development, and the durable storage box is the cherry on top. It’s perfect for kids and is one of the best LEGO values out there. Five stars! Highly recommended!",5,Macy C,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2025"

Amazon,Toys_Kids,kids toys,RKYCTN2C5Y6V4,Cute Little Cans of Play Doh - Good Color Selection,"There’s a reason Play Doh is still the go-to brand after all these years. Fun and safe. This set is packaged for shipping, not for retail shelves. Not the best price you can find, but pretty good with free shipping. 2oz cans are tiny, but not as tiny as the 1oz ones. 4oz seems standard for “full size” these days, so these cans are half sized. Old school cans (the chipboard ones with the metal bottoms) apparently held 6oz, so these are a third of what full size used to be. Though modern Play Doh may be denser. These cans do seem quite small. The color selection is great, with the six rainbow colors, black, white, hot pink and teal. Since they’re basically “travel size” cans but with a good color selection, this set would be ideal for travel. These are perfect for stocking stuffers, additions to gift bags, etc. They’d also be a great option for creating little custom Play Doh kits with unique tools not necessarily marketed for use with Play Doh - to promote creative thinking. Lots of different ways to use or gift these cans. I bought several to gift for toy drives and 100 neediest cases families.

Amazon,Toys_Kids,kids toys,R3NGL4IVYO4LDW,Unleashing Creativity with Play-Doh's 10-Pack Case of Colors,"When it comes to finding activities that both entertain and educate my children, I always strive to give them experiences that not only spark their imagination but also enhance their developmental skills. That's why I was thrilled to discover the Play-Doh Modeling Compound 10-Pack Case of Colors, exclusively available on Amazon. This delightful set has quickly become a household favorite, bringing joy and creative flair to our family's daily routine. From the moment we opened the package, the vibrant array of colors captivated everyone’s attention. The set includes ten 2 oz. cans, each filled with a different, brilliant hue. The colors are not only appealing but also inspire a multitude of creative projects. Whether it's sculpting simple shapes or crafting intricate models, these Play-Doh cans provide the perfect material for all ages, making it an ideal choice for my children, who are 2 and 5 years old. What sets this Play-Doh set apart is its commitment to safety and quality. The compound is non-toxic, making it safe for younger children who are still prone to exploring textures with their hands and mouths. As a parent, it’s reassuring to know that the products I give to my children are free from harmful chemicals and safe for their use. Each play session with our Play-Doh case turns into a mini adventure. The kids start by choosing their favorite colors and then move on to decide what they want to create. On one occasion, my eldest decided to make a colorful garden with blue, green, and yellow Play-Doh, while my youngest was happy rolling balls and making small figures. Their creativity was astounding, and it was a joy to see their different personalities shine through their creations. The quality of the Play-Doh is commendable. Unlike some other modeling clays that dry out quickly or crumble, this compound retains its elasticity and vibrancy even after many uses. It's also easy to clean up, which as any parent knows, is a huge plus. We simply gather any stray pieces, store them back in their respective cans, and they're good as new for next time. Moreover, the addition of non-toxic Play-Doh to our play routine has provided a tactile learning experience for my children. Manipulating the dough helps develop their motor skills, and distinguishing between colors teaches them about the visual spectrum. They also learn problem-solving as they figure out how to manipulate the dough to match their creative vision. To enhance our Play-Doh sessions, we often incorporate educational themes. For example, we've used the dough to practice numbers and letters. I ask my children to form the shapes of different numbers and letters with the dough, which makes learning more interactive and fun. We also use the dough to form shapes and objects that relate to the stories we read together, deepening their understanding and engagement with the material. The inclusivity of Play-Doh also encourages sharing and cooperative play. My children have learned to share colors and tools, take turns showcasing their creations, and even collaborate on joint projects, like building a Play-Doh zoo that houses all sorts of colorful animals. These are valuable social skills that they carry into their interactions at preschool and playdates. In conclusion, the Play-Doh Modeling Compound 10-Pack Case of Colors has been a fantastic addition to our family’s playtime. It not only entertains my children but also serves as a tool for education and social development. The safety, quality, and vibrancy of this product make it a worthwhile purchase for any family with young children. I wholeheartedly recommend it to any parent looking to enrich their child's playtime with creativity and learning. Every can of Play-Doh holds a rainbow of potential, and we look forward to many more hours of fun and creation.",5,daniel,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2024"

Trying to assemble this thing at 9pm, sleep-deprived and fueled by candy cane rage, was like being handed blueprints to the Death Star, told “you got this,” and then blindfolded while Luke Skywalker starts his trench run. Pieces the size of small macaroni’s. Instructions translated from ancient Martian. One piece mysteriously labeled “Part 4B” when no such thing exists in this universe. I stared into the abyss, and the abyss was shaped like a dollhouse roof panel. That said, once the final screw was in and my mental breakdown was complete, it looked amazing. It’s sturdy, adorable, and my kid immediately moved in like it was rent-controlled. She loves it. I needed a nap and possibly a support group.

I unlocked the delete toggle on the back, pressed the delete button, and voila… no more marks on the screen. Then I just slid them back into their individual sleeves. This 4-pack is a decent deal for a lower quantity. Colors were as expected. I tested em before gifting. These little tablets are very simple - easy to use.

The only two issues I had with them is the pen is a bit hard to remove and they would be so much better if they came with magnets. They have the spots where magnets usually would be, however finding magnets for them I have found is an absolute nightmare. All the ones you can cut to shape and all of that do not hold it or are not thick enough to fill up the space for it. These are definitely a five-star item for just simple laying around the house use, but my entire use of them is notes on the refrigerator. I have a boogie board that I absolutely love but I cannot find them at a good value anymore. The bottom of mine broke so the pen does not stay in very well which is why I was replacing it. If these had a pen that was not so tough to get out I would give them five stars all day.

Right away I noticed the quality has gone downhill from my old version. The game board is barely thicker than posterboard so you'll need to be very careful with that. The cards are beyond thin - I had to laminate each one to give it longevity. The Candyland story insert was ripped upon receipt. Better quality materials need to be used since young kids are using this. Aside from quality problems, we love the classic game. My 4 and 10 year olds love the game, even though the 10 year old is way old for it, but we like to play as a family. It's the competitiveness for her that keeps her interested. Game play is simple, you choose cards and go the matching color, some spaces are double colors to move 2 instead of one. The best part is the specialty cards, in this version some of the characters are different such as the ice cream for Duke of Swirl and Grandma Gooey. What makes the game so fun is that you can be all the way at the end and get a specialty card like the cupcake that sends you back. My 4 year old is learning sight words, but can't read yet and no reading is required for this game. Each round can take 2-7 minutes depending on what cards you get, good for kids with short attention span. Classic family fun!",4,Olivia Stabler,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2022"

The rules are simple enough for young players (ages 6+) to pick up quickly, but the strategic aspect keeps everyone engaged and thinking ahead. The game grid is sturdy and easy to set up, and the checkers slide smoothly into place. I appreciate the compact design, which makes it easy to store and bring along for travel.

Amazon,Toys_Kids,children games,R2OKVDNMWVE01P,Amazing Interactive Device for Kids — Keeps Them Active and Engaged!,"The Nex Playground turned out to be one of the best kids’ tech purchases we’ve made in a long time. It’s a small cube-shaped camera that connects to the TV and tracks children’s movements in the room. No controllers, no remotes — the kids themselves become the characters on the screen. It feels like having an interactive playground right in the living room. ✅ Easy Setup Setting it up took just a couple of minutes. You plug it into the power and into your TV with HDMI, follow a few simple on-screen steps, and it’s ready to go. The device calibrates the room, connects to Wi-Fi, and immediately recognizes players. ✅ Truly Active Play What I love most is that this is not passive screen time. My kids jump, run, reach, dance, and move constantly during the games. After 20–30 minutes they’re happy, tired “in a good way,” and definitely more active than they would be with a tablet or phone. ✅ Great Variety of Games The game library is surprisingly diverse. There are sports games, dancing games, obstacle courses, fun coordination mini-games, and even cooperative challenges for siblings or friends. You can choose games for different ages and moods, which is perfect for families with multiple kids. ✅ Very Kid-Friendly The interface is simple, bright, and easy for children to navigate. There are no controllers to drop, lose, or break. Kids just stand in front of the TV and move — that’s it. Even younger kids figure it out almost instantly. ✅ Fun for the Whole Family This isn’t only for kids! Adults can join in and play too, and it turns into a super fun family activity. Great for rainy days, weekends, or playdates. ⸻ ⭐ What I Appreciate Most • Encourages physical activity • Helps reduce phone/tablet time • Kids stay engaged and entertained for a long time • Works well for single players or groups • Turns the living room into an interactive game space ⸻ ⚠️ Things to Keep in Mind Nothing major, but a few practical notes: • You need a bit of space in front of the TV for the camera to see the players properly. • Good lighting improves accuracy. Dim rooms can make the tracking less precise. • Younger kids can sometimes run out of frame and the device may “lose” them briefly — easily fixed by marking a play zone with a rug or tape. • A stable Wi-Fi connection helps games load faster. ⸻ ✅ Final Verdict The Nex Playground is a fantastic alternative to passive screen time and a great way to keep kids active, engaged, and laughing. The tracking works really well, the setup is quick, and the game selection is excellent. My kids absolutely love it, and I highly recommend it to any family looking for fun, movement, and something different from traditional video games.

My 4 year old daughter uses it several times a week. Even my 11 and 13 year old boys enjoy playing it! I take it to work on ""Fun Fridays"". I'm a Cas Manager for adults with disabilities. Some of them only have the use of one arm and because of the AI body tracking these people who have never played a video game in their lives are having the time of their lives! My favorites are the bowling game (wow, how accurate the ball follows your hand movement), connect 4/basketball game, the baseball game (a huge hit with my boys and my clients), the mini game compilation game (ridiculous fun), the cookie monster puzzle game (cooperative gaming fun), the Mario kart inspired racing game (takes me back to the Wii era), the arrow shooting game (super fun to aim and hit targets), Zumba (is a great workout) and there are so much more and even more games are released throughout the year! I really believe this console deserves a place in every home in America! It's such a great time! A great workout! And I hope Nintendo is paying close attention!

Amazon,Gardening_Outdoor,lawn tools,R8J012XEVKRU1,Great battery mower!!!,"Have had this mower for several months now and am ready to offer my opinion ... I really do like this mower!! This is the first battery operated mower I have owned and was a bit worried when I bought it. We have a little over a 1/4 acre and our yard is mostly flat. Have had many gas powered mowers and was ready to try the battery craze!! And, I'm glad I did. The mower operates smoothly - is very quiet and light weight. Glad I did not opt to spend the extra money on self propelled. One battery will usually do the whole yard - about 35-45 minutes of run time. The height adjustment is easy - the few controls are easy - the whole process -- easy!! Loading the battery is simply. No vibration. No running to get gas in the can. No gas can in the garage. Very simple to operate and own. Does a nice job of cutting. I do the mulching option and will eventually try the bag just to see what it's like. Bought several other tools from this company and am happy with them all - and having extra batteries (the one battery fits all is a MUST and really works well). The only negative about this mower is the size - I purchased the smaller 16"" cutting path and, although I really don't need bigger, it might save a little time (ok, just being a bit lazy to be honest!!). I would recommend this mower and this brand. Make sure each tool uses the same battery - just a suggestion - because it makes life easier with 3 batteries - there is always one charged and ready. (I also bought the weed eater and blower for those curious) Great product and I only hope I'm still this happy with it next year and the year after ..... happy mowing!",5,Joseph,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2025"
Amazon,Gardening_Outdoor,lawn tools,RNTPAZLUBEU90,Best mower I’ve ever had! So done with gas.,"I bought this in July of 2020. It’s the 16”. I needed something to cut regular grass, but had nowhere to store it. I kept a plywood panel over it as a lean to in the winter, but rain and snow would still get in on it. In 2023 winter, it had absolutely no cover. I’ve since moved to a place without real grass but tons of honeysuckle bushes and weeds, and I’ve used it heavily to keep acres of it cut down. I just finally bought a new blade for it, since I had beat up mine enough. This thing isn’t super strong or big, but it’s undergone so much hard labor I am so impressed it’s still going strong. The battery lasts long, no problems. The value for the money has definitely been amazing. I’ve used it each year heavily. If I were to get another one, I’d prob get a larger size just cuz now I have acreage, but same time, so impressed with this little mower as is!!! Lightweight, easy for me and the kids to manage. Love it!!",5,Lora,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2025"
Amazon,Gardening_Outdoor,lawn tools,R2P2BDGP5LBMC8,My first lawnmower for my first lawn-,"I couldn't spend too much, and didn't know what to expect, so because the lawn hadn't been mowed in at least a couple months- it was overgrown when I took possession a month ago, and is probably 7 inches long in some spots- I had to get a mower, and was overwhelmed with all the choices. I'm not mechanically inclined, & if anything can be done backwards, I always end up getting it backwards & have to redo it... Assembly of this out of the box was pretty easy. You just have to add the upper handle and the clipping-catch bag, and charge the battery. Now, some of the issues I had are probably due to the long and slightly-damp-underneath grass I had to cut. I may not get another chance to mow before it snows. It's been raining more days than it's been dry lately. I thought this mower would be sufficient because it said it could mow 1/3 an acre on a charge, which is about what I have between the back and front yard. I also have a pretty bad back, so I knew I wouldn't be able to do the entire lawn without a break at least every hour. I tend to overdo it, so if a dead battery forces me to stop & take a break, that is for the best. In the end, I only got half the back yard done yesterday on the one battery charge...and now it's raining again, which it's predicted to do until it starts snowing in a couple days. Part of the problem is also that there is a big tree in the back yard plus neighbor's trees dropping leaves into my yard, and I've been trying to get all the leaves off the ground before mowing, and it's impossible! I thought a thin layer of leaves would be okay, but no. It was just too much for the mower, with the grass so long too. I had to keep stopping to rake because the clippings were jamming up the blade and underneath. So I had to rake more leaves and bag up the clippings around it. Yes, it does have a catch bag, but only about half the clippings make it into the bag; the rest stay on the ground as mulch, even when you first start mowing! That part disappoints me, because after the mowing is done, you still have to rake up mounds of mulch (yes, I removedd the mulch piece because I didn't want any, but maybe I got that backwards). The manual did leave a few explanations out. It is kind of hard for me to push, but I am more than half disabled. I probably should have paid the extra approx. $200 for the self-propelled model- but that is so much money for someone on a fixed income. Again, I think a big part of the problem was the too overgrown grass. I first tried the shortest setting, but that was impossible to push over that heavy grass! I used setting 2, which was still hard to push, but with the days left before winter being so few, I had to. Hence my having to unjam it every few minutes. Next year I'll be able to mow more often, and not let it get so out of control! I didn't have the problem someone else mentioned about it stalling while pulling back on a hill. My yard is pretty hilly/bumpy in spots, but that wasn't a problem. The manual said all 4 wheels have to be on the ground, but if they briefly aren't, it still works. I haven't gotten to the part under the tree with all the acorns- I'll be wearing safety glasses as the manual instructs. I will still need an edger/weed whacker, because you can't get too close to the garden beds/walkway/fence/tree, etc. with this mower. I guess the same would be true for any mower. I do wish I had bought the wider model, and the 2-battery model. Lawn mowing with this model is a lot of work for me. But I think I'll keep it, and next year will vow to mow regularly so it doesn't jam so much. The biggest disappointment of all is that all the clippings don't make it into the bag, and that leaves on the ground can't be mowed over. Hopefully I won't be too crippled next year to mow, because I really want to get in shape, and this push mower is very good exercise! Also- I love the color, and it's cute and not TOO heavy. The battery is average power toll-size, so that doesn't add weight, just the mower body itself.",4,Star,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2025"
Amazon,Gardening_Outdoor,lawn tools,R2I5EEM5BKI4XF,"""A man's got to know his limitations."" - Excellent mower!","When Dirty Harry says ""A man's got to know his limitations."" that's true for this mower. If you're a dingbat who doesn't mow their lawn for weeks on end until the grass is so high a gas mower craps out every three feet, then this mower isn't for you. In fact a gas mower isn't for you, just hire someone and get it done. Alternatively you could wait until a You-tuber who does sympathy mows for neglected yards shows up at your door and offers to clean up your hovel. The mower is easy to use and requires very little maintenance. I have a 15 year old son who would rather be a goldbrick than mow when needed. I bought a couple of extra aftermarket batteries for him when he slacks and waits until the grass is so high we're about to be justifiably pestered by the HOA. I personally like the mower. It's very quiet, cuts well, and easy to maneuver. Battery capacity could be greater, but it's fine for a typical lawn that is mowed weekly. The self propel feature works great. You can collect the clippings, side discharge, or mulch. I always mulch. The only maintenance I anticipate is sharpening/changing the blade and keeping the mower clean.

Multi-tasking, cooking too high. Almost burning food. Mind you, we have food allergies/sensitivities, so I must cook all our food from scratch. I cook more than 5 meals a day as a homeschooling mommy of 2. (Family of 4.) . The sets usually last me 10 month torturing them. Still non stick After scratching and the ceramic looking dark and seasoned from overheating. Shopping around, I ended up going with Carote a 3rd time. This time I am being much more careful. Starting on medium and then turning it a bit down. I am still getting crispy bacon, browned chicken nuggets made from scratch etc. My last two sets were dark grey and dark cream. This bright cream set worried me. I have made plenty of red spaghetti sauce with no staining. I did read reviews and made sure I chose their line with the name granite in it this purchase. Now that I am cooking intentionally, my pans are not turning dark on the bottom interior and exterior. They are lasting much longer. If you get a defective handle. Being they are wood, they will replace. I do not submerge the lids in water, so water doesn't get in between the hollow area of the glass and handle. I love Carote. This set will definitely last me over a year this time. I was too scared to do the stainless steel having to worry about where they are made as each brand has many coming from different places, lawsuits, and the concern with really being careful. I like the silicone spatula it comes with. Nice size, and my girls like the colorful sprinkle design. I am so happy not having to spend hundreds on a set that disappoints. These are better than the home store brands that sell indvidual ceramic pieces. These do not stick and last way longer. I have had this set for a few months now and they are still looking brand new. When it comes to stacking any pots and pans, I use the fabric star looking things my first Carote set came with to put in between for storage. I am buying another set. I just love the sizes.

Amazon,Kitchen_Dining,cookware,R23XABBO2241XG,My new favorite cookware!,"We used non-stick cookware for years before we ditched it for stainless steel & cast iron because of health concerns. We've not been entirely thrilled with stainless steel - I suppose it's better for your health, but the cleanup is awful - stuff sticks to it like crazy and I'm constantly either madly scrubbing it, or putting it back on the stove with water to boil off whatever food got cooked onto it before trying to clean it with soapy water. Cast iron is awesome in certain situations, like searing steak, but I've also found it a challenge to maintain so I don't strip the ""seasoning"" off of it. I've heard and read great things about ceramic non-stick cookware, but until having an opportunity to try this set, I just wasn't willing to take the leap. Let me tell you - I absolutely love this 9 piece ceramic cookware set - it does not disappoint! - It is cleverly designed - perfect for smaller kitchens with less storage space. There is one universal handle that clips easily onto each piece, the lid for the saucepan has an elevated lip so the handle still fits while securely covering the pot - The nonstick surface heats quickly and evenly, and was perfectly stick-resistant, even with scrambled eggs (see pic), which I have found stick to absolutely everything and are a huge mess to clean up! The eggs slid off like magic, & once the pan was cool, a quick wash in warm water with mild dish soap got it squeaky clean. So awesome! One important note - though the set comes with basic instructions, there is no mention of whether or not you should add cooking oil to the pan. I looked it up, and the internet consensus is that using a bit of butter or oil (though not spray oil) will not only make the non-stick surface work better, but it will also protect and preserve the non-stick surface by keeping it oiled. Kind of seems like an important point to miss in the directions, so I thought I'd mention it here... - I love the thoughtful inclusion of the 2 sturdy fabric storage protectors... I usually use paper towels to protect my non-stick cookware when it's stacked in the cabinet, but they don't do a great job protecting the surface, they slide all over the place, and eventually fall to the back of the cabinet, which is super annoying. So having these cute and sturdy pan protectors to stack everything neatly is a huge bonus. - Along the same lines, I love that 2 handy silicone utensils are included with the set, so that you can use everything right out of the box! Honestly, if I didn't have non-scratch utensils on hand and got this set, I can see myself using the wrong kind of utensil in my enthusiasm to try out the set, potentially scratching the set right out of the box. I can't imagine I'm the only person who would do that, so it's awesome that utensils are included right in the package. - That said, while the spatula is perfect, the ladle is kind of comically large for the small saucepan included in this set. It appears that some sets include a larger pot, in that case the ladle makes sense. Still, it is nice to have on hand. - This set is a great value - really reasonable for what you get, plus other cookware that I have seen in stores are so much more expensive! - The blue and white color scheme is so cheerful - it brightens my kitchen and makes me smile! All of my other cookware has always been gray and black, that is fine, but I was pleasantly surprised how much joy the color of this set brings me - This set would make a great housewarming gift, and it's also perfect for college students who are living in small, dorm-sized apartments My only wish is that lids were provided for the saute pans - the lids from my stainless steel set do work with these standard size pans, but if you're starting out and this is your first set, it's a shame that the lids for each piece aren't included. Overall, I can't recommend this set highly enough - totally love it!",5,Anna Smith,FALSE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2025"
Amazon,Kitchen_Dining,cookware,R1883SN52JDNUT,Good functional cookware,"I got this cookware set a little while back to try out because I wanted something versatile for everyday cooking without sacrificing space in the cabinets, and honestly it’s been mostly pleasant to use. Right out of the box it looked nicer than I expected for the price — the pieces are a good mix of sizes for all the things I cook most often, and the detachable handles are actually way more useful than I thought they’d be. Being able to snap the handles on and off means I can stack everything up neatly in the cupboard, and when I need to go from the stovetop to the oven it’s less of a juggling act compared to my old set. Cooking on induction and gas has both been fine, and nothing has stuck to the surfaces yet even when I was less careful than I should’ve been. Cleaning up is pretty easy too — I’ve wiped them down after dinner and they haven’t shown weird residue or stains. The lids fit snugly, which helps with both simmering and keeping splatters down, and I’ve even used them in the oven a couple times without worrying about the handles. That said, the finish on these isn’t crazy heavy duty — if you’re used to thick professional pans you’ll feel the difference, and I’ve noticed the heat distribution takes a bit longer to get even than my old set. Also the detachable handles take a moment to get used to, especially when you've got hot stuff inside, since you do have to make sure they’re clicked on solidly before moving anything. And while everything stacks nicely, it does take a couple extra seconds to click the handles on and off every time you use them. Overall, it’s been a solid addition to my kitchen. I like how flexible the pieces are and how much easier it is to store them without the bulky handles in the way. For everyday cooking it checks all the boxes for me, and I’ve reached for it way more than I thought I would when I first opened the box.",5,Mike P,FALSE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2025"
Amazon,Kitchen_Dining,cookware,R1PZBMFMEGOJ5I,"Compact, Beautiful, and Perfect for Small Kitchens or First Apartments","This Malta Blue Carote set is such a pleasant surprise. The color is bright and cheerful without feeling childish, and the ceramic interior gives it a clean, polished look. Although this is a smaller nine piece set, the essentials are all here. You get two frying pans, a saucepan with a silicone rimmed lid, utensils, pan protectors, and the removable handle system. Everything feels sturdy, and the nonstick performance is just as reliable as the larger Carote sets I already own. One of the standout features is how beginner friendly this set is. Someone who is just setting up a kitchen does not need a dozen specialty pieces. They need the core pieces that will carry them through everyday meals, and this set delivers exactly that. The detachable handle design keeps the whole collection compact, and once the handle is removed, the pieces nest tightly together. It saves a tremendous amount of cabinet space, which is especially helpful for new cooks who may be working with a limited kitchen. The silicone lid also makes it easy to cook, store, and reheat in the same pot without moving food around. This set also makes a thoughtful gift. It is affordable without feeling cheap, and it gives the recipient a practical but attractive start. Whether it is for someone moving into a dorm, a first apartment, or even an RV, this little set checks every box. It heats evenly, it cleans beautifully, and it looks far more expensive than the current price. A lovely, useful, confidence boosting starter set.

Amazon,Kitchen_Dining,cookware,RI1VJ2864IFLQ,I don't know why I didn't go stainless steel until now! - update,"The media could not be loaded. UPDATE: I just had to update this review. I fried an egg and as you can see, with the proper knowledge, this egg slid around the pan just like those fancy pots and pans with little to no clean up.! I don't like to cook, I do not eat a lot of fried foods and I rarely give 5 stars. I did my homework on cooking with stainless steel. You CAN NOT cook the same as you have on that nasty nonstick stuff. I wanted to wait until I used both a saucepan and frypan. Saucepan: I boil my chicken and add Mrs. Dash to the water. Normally, there would be bubbling/seasoning stuck all over the sides at this point. The pictures shows no sticking and even boiling. They had been boiling for at least 20 minutes. I did put a little veggie oil in the water. It cleaned up VERY easy, dried immediately (do your homework!) and is just fine. Frying (uncovered): I heated the pan, tested with water and then added my oil (olive oil this time) (all as instructed by DOING MY HOMEWORK). Onions was all I had, so I cut them up and put them in for sautéing. Once they started to brown, I reduced the heat from low/medium to low. I stirred them until I was happy with the coloring and then took my 2 squares of ground turkey (I package my meat in single servings to freeze) laid them on top of the onions, salt and peppered them and cut them into sections for frying. After about 10 minutes I went back and they moved easily with NO sticking. After 20 minutes I flipped them and dumped some parmesan cheese on top. Once done, I removed them and made 3 meals out of it. You can see the condition of the pan immediately after removing the food. It is nearly clean and there's still oil in the pan! I could have easily washed it at that point, but I wanted to eat :) I put some hot water in the pan and set it back on the burner, now turned off. I went out 30 minutes later and was able to wipe it clean with just a warm soapy dish rag. Easy peasy! Utensil: A wooden spoon (of sorts). It only has a slight depression so I guess it's not really a 'spoon', however, it is what I used for the entire process, flipping and all. This is just a basic set, but it is all ""I"" need. I have a cast iron grill pan for steaks and bacon and a small one for a turkey burger when I'm in a hurry. Also, I used the cardboard inserts they came with for spacers until I found-https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087M6W31J?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details. Who knew of such things :) So, in conclusion for all those bad reviews (most are of burnt food), that's what you get for not researching how to cook with stainless steel. It's just too bad that the vendor had to take the hit for your ignorance. Taken care of correctly (and I don't think it's a lot of work, frankly, it's easier than those nasty 'nonstick' pans) these are amazing and I got them on sale for $140! I did a lot of looking before I settled on this set. It's very comparably priced and I would grab them up before they're discontinued. I also got the small saucepan for this set from Lowe's.

Amazon,Kitchen_Dining,cookware,R3P777PUOTX5C6,Very Impressive Cookware,"This is my first stainless steel cookware set, and I did some research before I started cooking. This set is very nice and comfortable when cooking. Very durable to high heat and clean up was easy. There were no hot spots and my chicken came out cooked evenly. I used these tips when searing my chicken and this should be done when using stainless steel: -Wash your cookware before using with a detergent that doesn't have citrus in it. No lemon fresh Dawn. Just use regular dish detergent. -Heat your pan for 2 minutes before adding oil or food. You have to take it from cold to hot before adding oil. Or your food will stick. Use low to medium heat. Check with some drops of water to see if they bead up. Then you're ready to cook. -Fat and Butter is Stainless Steel's best friend. After heating your pan for 2 minutes use Avocado or Grapeseed oil to make cooking surface non stick, not Olive oil or regular butter. Olive oil and butter are not durable fats and oils to sustain the heat in stainless steel, but they are for non stick. Avocado and Grapeseed oil burns slower on high heat. -You can tell when you heat is too high if your oil starts drying out. Add a splash more during cooking. -Turn the heat down some when cooking. You only need the higher heat to get the pan hot. Once hot, you can reduce heat. Stainless steel is not like nonstick. It's very different. If your food burns, you had your pan too hot or you used the wrong oil or not enough oil. Towards the end of cooking you can add your butter because you should have had time to lower the temperature. Just don't add butter at the beginning. -When you take your meat out of the pan to rest, let your pan cool for a few minutes and then wash while meat is resting. Perfect time to wash cookware! Wash in warm to hot water. Cold water will make hot stainless steel warp. Use gentle detergent. I also used the soft side of Scrub Daddy because it's gentle to stainless steel. If you have tougher stains, use Brillo or SOS pads. -Dry your cookware immediately after washing to preserve the finish. Additional tip: Brillo pads are good to clean stainless steel. Don't be afraid to use Brillo or SOS. It even says so on the box.",5,Sinclair Jacobs,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2024"

When cooking sauces, gravy, pudding, etc. everything just runs down the side of the pot while stirring. Nice, well fitting lids. Hard to believe the hype about cookware, especially non-stick, but if they continue to hold up like they have for the last year or so they might actually be the last pans I have to buy.

Amazon,Kitchen_Dining,cookware,R2VS6MZFAH2JVL,Great quality and versatility - and fun to use,"Really happy with the set so far. Also purchased the pans from Costco. After years of buying lower quality pans, which normally are only good for a few years, we are very impressed with the performance so far. The pots and pans feel solid, and I am really impressed with the lids, too. Our gas cooktop's steel grates have beat up the bottoms of sets in the past, but the bottoms of the Hexclads are handling them well so far. Perhaps my only small complaint is that the handles and lids are too shiny to hide fingerprints or smudges even after they are washed. Reading through endless reviews about Hexclad and other high end brands, I've concluded the following: 1. For our cooking needs, which is versatility and family use, these were the best fit. Our goal was not to buy the last set in our lifetime or the absolute best in the world, but something that is non-stick, easy to use for our kids (i.e., not stainless), and lasts for more than a couple years. 2. A fair amount of negative reviews (and those with photos) were questionable. Lots of complaints about the non-stick with photos of dirty pans. I could not help but feel like directions were not followed, such as proper heating up, seasoning of pans (initial and oils during regular use) and just general care. We have cooked all sorts of things so far and have not had issues. 3. With a number of complaints about customer service from Hexclad directly, we decided to purchase ours from Costco and Amazon. I feel like quality issues with products are known pretty quickly, so I am confident we will be okay should anything arise in the short term, which we can go through Amazon or Costco. If you cannot replace an item 5-10 years down the road due to cost or whatever, you should not be playing in this price point in the first place. Again, this is for casual home use with a large family, where we did not want to get into stainless steel type cookware, which I'm sure is amazing - but not for a family with kids. We wanted something that was great quality and did not require any guesswork into the use and care.

I read reviews for many sets & was not looking to spend a fortune on a silverware set as these are for my vacation home I recently acquired & need some good basic things like these.

Alot of reviews with other sets of stainless steel had claims of early rust issues were this one did not have those issue claims (that I saw in reviews). You also have the choice of a normal & heavy duty set, I went with the normal & WoW these are sturdy ! The necks of the forks are ""meaty"" so not going to bend unless you REALLY put abnormal amount of pressure on them. Small spoon nice size as are the salad forks, the larger fork if perfect sized & although some reviewed the large spoon too big, I find it nice & large for soup as they should be !

Amazon,Mens_Clothing,mens clothing,R385K8YJS22CLP,Several things to be aware of,"FOR REFERENCE: I bought 2 of the sweatshirts in Stonewash Green, sizes Medium and Large. My intent was to find something reasonably priced, warm, and comfy to wear - mainly so I could quickly put together a basic, casual, and decent looking outfit that was suitable to wear in public. I wanted a sweatshirt I could launder at least 15 times before it became too worn out looking to try to wear at a social event. Even after the appearance degraded, I still wanted the sweatshirt to remain warm, comfy, and in tact so I could wear it while lounging inside my home or during other situations that didn't require me to look quite as put together. I'm a female, 5'6 tall, about 115 lbs, 32C bra size, 26 inch waist, and 36.5 inch hips. I have slightly broader shoulders and a slightly longer torso than the average female of my size. I have a slender build. I wanted one sweatshirt to fit pretty loose (for layering and comfort) and another to have a trendy oversized looked. I definitely should have bought larger sizes, and I don't think these sweatshirts will hold up the way I had hoped. MAIN THOUGHTS: Overall quality is ""barely okay."" (I guess it really depends on how you intend to use this sweatshirt and the pricing. You may find the quality to be acceptable... or very disappointing.) Shrinks a lot after just one wash - almost by a size and a half. Shrinkage is more drastic in the length of the body and sleeves, but also affects the width. Overall, does not launder well under ""normal conditions."" You may have to be very careful to avoid any heat or abrasiveness to keep this sweatshirt looking its best for as long as possible. (Not worth the effort, IMO.) Stains show easily on this particular color and are surprisingly difficult to remove. Possible dye issues. The large sweatshirt came out with what appears to be bleached/faded spots on the bottom banding. (We don't use bleach or a lot of harsh chemicals in my home due to allergies and skin sensitivity issues. So, I'm not sure how this occured. No other clothing item came out of the laundry with the same problem.) Already noticed some slight pilling in spots. Barely noticeable now, but this is only after one laundry session. Sweatshirts aren't very warm, but they are comfortable (as long as you get the correct size). If you choose to buy this sweatshirt, I'd recommend you buy 1-2 sizes larger to account for shrinkage and to allow for layering. If you only plan to wear a thin tank top underneath, you probably don't need to size up too much. But if you plan to wear a long sleeve thermal underneath and still want a loose fit, I'd go up 2 sizes. MORE SPECIFIC DETAILS: This sweatshirt is between light-weight and mid-weight thickness. It's more suitable to wear during chilly/cooler days in the Fall or Spring. It's not enough to keep someone warm during very cold Winter weather without adding several layers underneath and on top. I wore both sweatshirts twice before washing them. Once with only a tank top underneath, and once with a thin long sleeve thermal underneath. Then I machine washed them in semi-warm water and dried them on medium heat (being careful not to leave them in the dryer more than necessary). BEFORE LAUNDERING: Both sweatshirts felt slightly rough (nothing really bothersome or too noticeable) and disappointingly thin. The color was as expected - a lovely muted, pale green. One sweatshirt arrived with excess threads hanging from the bottom. But I was able to safely cut them off without risk of anything unraveling. I liked the way both tops fit and draped. The sizes were as I hoped they would be. I accidentally spilled a cold, milky coffee drink on the smaller sweatshirt. I treated it with a pre-wash stain remover. Then threw both sweatshirts in the washer with a pair of jeans and no-lint sports towel (all similar colors as the sweatshirts). AFTER LAUNDERING: Both tops became softer and slightly fluffier after washing. This made them feel a bit thicker and warmer. Both were noticably smaller, though. The large top now fits similar to the way the medium used to fit. Except it's a tad bit shorter. Both tops no longer drape the way they did before I washed them. It's not a huge issue for me, though. The banding on both tops also shrank a bit. I no longer like the way the medium fits me. Prior to washing, the end of the sleeves reached halfway down my fingers. The sleeve cuffs were loose enough that I could have them drape that way, but just snug enough that I could pull them back around my wrists. Now the wrist cuffs sit snuggly around my wrists. When I reach for items above my head, the sleeves pull back a bit, exposing more of my wrists... and the waist hem rides up so that I have to yank it down when I drop my arms back down to my sides. (That's how badly the top shrank in length after just one wash!) The brown color from where I spilled my coffee on the medium top was gone, but there's still a visible stain. It just looks a couple shades darker than the sweatshirt color... like I spilled water on myself and it's starting to dry a bit. (I'm going to try a different stain remover and wash it again. Hopefully it works, otherwise this top will permanently look dirty.) As I already mentioned, the larger top had some pale pumkin-yellow spots on the lower banding - similar to what bleach spots would look like. I'm okay with the fit of the larger size sweatshirt even after it shrank. So, it's a shame that the color bled the way it did. Overall, I'm disappointed with my purchases. These are already going to be dedicated lounging and housework shirts. They are a bit warmer and very soft inside, which is nice. And nothing has unraveled, so it seems the stitching is good. I don't think these would be great for screen-printing, simply because of the amount of shrinkage and the fact that they're already showing signs of pilling in areas that don't get much friction. Hope this info helps. If anything, these aren't bad sweatshirts to have on hand to adapt to temperature fluctuations. They're stretchy, so they're easy to quickly throw on as an extra layer and take off as needed. Just be mindful they leave some lint behind on 100% cotton shirts. The lint problem will probably diminish after a few washes, though.",3,A.J.,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2023"

The material is thick, soft, and feels high-quality the moment you put it on. It’s warm without being bulky, and the 100% cotton fabric is super comfortable for all-day wear. The fit is true-to-size, and the craftsmanship—especially the stitching and buttons—feels solid and built to last. The colors look even better in person, and the suede-style trim on the collar and cuffs adds a nice touch you don’t usually get at this price.

Amazon,Mens_Clothing,mens clothing,R3NWT46CD710I1,Shrinks to Proper Size,"I was looking for new flannel shirts that wouldn't break the bank and saw some recommendations for this brand. It arrived the next day and, frankly, I was disappointed. I ordered a Large, but this felt like XL or maybe even XXL. Additionally, the flannel didn't feel soft at all. In reading reviews, I saw many that mentioned how much they shrink, so I decided to chance it and wash on hot (recommendation was to wash cold). After washing and drying, the fit was absolutely PERFECT and the fabric was much softer. I really like the overall quality. The corduroy lining along the neck and cuffs makes it look really sharp. Quality buttons and stitching. The color combination was excellent. Not sure if Amazon allows mention of other brands, so I'll just say I compared it with flannel shirts that are twice as expensive. Legendary Whitetails is a bit heavier, but that's probably due to the corduroy. The flannel fabric is on par with the others in terms of thickness, which is to say, not as thick as I had hoped for, but still very good. Overall, I think this is a great value and I immediately purchased more shirts.",4,Richard N.,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2025"
Amazon,Mens_Clothing,mens clothing,R3MEA9CQS6BXLR,Great big and tall shirt for a big and tall dude,"Absolutely terrific shirts! I’m 6’6”, 320 lbs., with broad shoulders. It can be difficult to find clothes that are quality, look good, fit well, and reasonably priced. This shirt hits on all points! Immediately I tried it on. I noticed two awesome things right away: the softness of the material and the button placement. Many button down shirts these days leave a lot of fabric at the bottom where just one more button is be necessary for us tall folks. Otherwise the shirt stays tucked in but it also separates revealing one’s hairy belly button. Yikes! Cost cutting over customer satisfaction (I’m looking at you, Men’s Wearhouse). This shirt had that necessary button. The thickness of the shirt is excellent as well; nice for indoor wear. And the sleeves are long; no getting short changed here. Next came the laundry test. Many flannel shirts come out of a washing either shrunk, heavily wrinkled, or both. The shirt then looks “off” no matter what you try. This shirt (and two others I bought) came out true to size and wrinkled only slightly! I don’t own a dryer (dryers are a product of a secret society in cahoots with electric companies) so I hang dried the shirt, and it looks great! A quick steam, and it’s ready to wear. The corduroy on the collar and cuffs is a nice touch also, especially with the cuffs to add weight to the sleeves. Overall, these are my new favorites. I’ve bought three others to add to the three I’ve already purchased. With a large variety in colors, I’m sure I’ll purchase more. One tiny issue with this shirt: on the tip of one collar the pattern stopped in the white. See picture. It’s very small and won’t bother me in the slightest. But if my family notices it, they will be unrelenting in their jokes and jabs. It is what it is. :))",5,Big Red,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2025"

However, my quest for such a piece ended when I discovered the RANKEEF Tiger Eye Bracelet.

The tiger eye stones, known for their captivating appearance and perceived properties of bringing luck and protection, are paired with lava rock beads, adding an interesting textural contrast and visual appeal. Beyond its aesthetics, there's a certain charm to wearing a bracelet made from natural elements. The tiger eye and lava rock beads are not just visually appealing; they carry a sense of earthiness and grounding. Whether or not one subscribes to the belief in the healing properties of natural stones, there's an undeniable comfort in carrying a piece of nature with you. It serves as a subtle reminder of the world's natural beauty and complexity. Another aspect worth mentioning is the versatility of the RANKEEF Tiger Eye Bracelet.

The sole is gum rubber and the insides is cushioned, though not as cushioned as a typical running shoe, this shoe is ALMOST that comfy.

I usually wear a size 7 1/2 W in a running shoe, and the 7's fit great in this shoe with enough height for my high instep and enough room in the toe box so it doesn't scrunch my toes together.

The texture is lightweight, absorbs quickly, and doesn’t leave a sticky feeling. Within the first few days, I noticed my skin looking more balanced, with less shine in the T-zone and visibly smaller pores. It has also helped a lot to fade acne marks, which is something I had been trying to improve for a while. It reduces small blemishes without irritation and works perfectly with the rest of my routine. For the price and quality, it’s amazing!

Therefore, I skipped a day and thereafter have been applying regularly before going to bed. It also stings for a few minutes application, a sensation like burning or heat. I didn’t get any new redness or uneasiness. It doesn’t feel heavy or sticky and lasts whole night. My skin has improved within a couple of days, pores are visibly smaller and didn’t get new pimples.

I have seen a more even skin tone, reduction in pore size, and some flattening of wrinkles. I still have my ""11's"" wrinkles but they have reduced in inrensity. Or will soften tour skin without making it feel oily. I have tried retinol and other anti-aging products. Wasted a lot of money over the years... This stuff works! It is a little sticky but a little goes a long way. After application, just wait a few minutes for it to fully absorb. I use this with a different brand of hyaluronic acid mixed with some frankincense essential oil. I think I will try other products from this company to see how they work. Highly recommend.

Every morning I wake up with BABY SOFT skin, and I love all the skin-forward ingredients. The only thing that bugged me was that it stays slightly sticky once it’s applied and my face kept sticking to my pillowcase. My sister also commented how ‘oily’ she thought my face was and I had to explain it was this cream, not my face. 🤣🤷‍♀️ Super effective, and love the value compared to other things I’ve tried for twice the price that I saw no results from whatsoever!

As soon as I put it on, my face feels instantly hydrated, soft, and smooth — like my skin literally drinks it up. What I love most is the glow it gives. It makes my skin look healthy and refreshed, and I wake up in the morning with my face still feeling moisturized instead of tight or flaky. It layers great with my other products, and I’ve had zero irritation. If you have dry skin, this is honestly such a perfect moisturizer.

Amazon,Beauty_Personal_Care,skincare,R16TUOMZ0P2WAM,Good for Travel,"This was my first time using this Medicube product & I like it. It is on the heavier side & upon application, a bit sticky. However, like all skin prep products, letting it settle before applying other products is key. The stickiness goes away upon absorption by the skin. I'm inclined to use it at night or if during the day, without makeup, just sunscreen. It's weight is a bit much during the day (for me) if you like using foundation, contour, blush, powder, etc. I personally don't like layering a ton of makeup during the day - moisturizers or sunscreen, that's it. I don't find primers do much unless I'm going for the full coverage look, which is not often. I will pamper my face at night, though, and if my face looks like a glazed doughnut before I go to bed, it's happy. It has a very soothing & mosturizing feel to it, more so than some higher-end products I use. My skin is relatively dry (and mature) - the soft feel continues much longer than many products. I think this is a very good value for the money. I use Retin-A every 3 months to force a gentle peel & this feels awesome on my face when it shedding & sensitive. Nice travel size, texture & consistency. I would definitely recommend trying this if you like products with nacinamide & collagen.",5,Liz Palermo,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2025"

Sold on the results!!,"First, let me preface by saying I’m 56 years old so I have some crepey skin on my neck, crows feet and (thanks to genetics) I have bags under my eyes most days. I have tried SO MANY PRODUCTS. Clinique, Drunk Elephant, various drug store brands, and nothing really made a difference at all. This Medicube Collagen Jelly is AMAZING. My skin looks better after just 3 weeks of use than it has in years. My skin feels plump and healthy. I don’t wake up with bags under my eyes, and my turkey neck has been minimized. This even helps my hooded eyelids, when I apply it there. (I know it’s not recommend to use close to the eyes but so far I’ve had no issues when I use it on my eyelids). I know some folks don’t like the sticky texture but I only have that issue if I use too much when I apply it. I start with a small amount and build up to the amount I need. Then I put my regular moisturizer on top of it. Not only is this stuff a miracle in a jar, it’s affordable!! I am SOLD on this product with the results I’ve seen.

Amazon,Beauty_Personal_Care,skincare,RSM3HHXQNCODR,Very hydrating,"I got this set because I was traveling but I had only used the Byoma milky toner in the past and had really enjoyed that. The face wash is a tiny bit drying for dry skin types like mine but still felt good and no smell which I like. The toner I love and had already been using. Great way to get extra hydration. The serum is sort of like a thicker version of the toner but layers beautifully and adds even more moisture. The moisturizer is very good. Feels a little sticky/tacky on the skin which not everyone loves, but its great under makeup. Lastly the sunscreen is not thick, rubs in easily, and doesnt have an obnoxious scent or feel. All looks great under foundation, and when I use them at night I wake up with super glowy skin. Highly recommend.",5,Sophia Maranca,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2025"

Amazon,Beauty_Personal_Care,beauty products,R3I7B3BTUHA017,Actually work!,"Worked surprisingly well. I have allergies so I have a lot of issues with my eyes. Due to excessively rubbing my eyes along with aging, I have undereye bags forming with some wrinkles (crows feet) forming. I wasn't sure if these patches would be helpful. Considering all the products I have previously purchased with no result. These actually have helped. My eye bags are so much better after using these. I could tell a difference after one use but like most products, it's not a permanent result. The gold ones definitely have helped the most and arw the thickest ones in the box. The blue ones are thinner so if you aren't gentle they can tear. Overall I'd say they're fairly durable considering what they are used for. They do hydrate well and fit perfectly under the eye. I didn't have any issues with them sliding or falling off once in place. I was able to move around while it absorbed into my skin. It dries pretty quickly leaving my skin smooth and moisturized after removing. I would buy again. My eye bags are so much better now, My fark cicrles are gone and my wrinkles have significantly improved.

This stuff is super thick as well, a little goes a longgg way. It’s also such a good price. You get a lot of lotion for a fairly low cost & it’s lasted well over a month and a half without going through too much, which is really nice.

Amazon,Beauty_Personal_Care,beauty products,R2JXPEE54JY9WP,My sensory savior 🙏🏿,"I think this might be my new holy grail moisturizer. Before then, I used one of those urea/aha based exfoliating lotions that despite moisturizing capabilities didn't hold up in a dry home. Enters Eos, after a browsing reddit beauty post. Why it's my HG: It's non-greasy consistency for one, absorbs fast and it leaves you soft and moisturized for hours. It's not tacky, goopy and gross which is a sensory ick to me. The scent is not in your face strong or cloying, but like buttery vanilla frosting, and it's a lasting scent for something that light. It's still on my nightgown, and I'm sure if I had a guy, he'd probably want to smell my skin every time. Lastly it's good quality for the price point, but I'm a little biased since I loved their lip balms in the little orb, I figured it couldn't hurt. It was a toss up between this and Nivea but IIRC they were about $11 vs $8 and some change for Eos 16oz. I'm indulgent, but frugal, so this won out in the end.

It's a generous size for the price, the bottle is nicely designed, and it really adds moisture to my dry arms and legs. I like it so much I'm using it daily despite the scent being....confusing. At first sniff, on my skin, this smells EXACTLY like pistachio gelato tastes. Creamy, smooth, not too sweet. Then there's a faint metallic tang. It's a fragrance, overall, that I can't say I mind, but it's probably not something I would usually choose to smell like. I was expecting a less literal interpretation of ""creme de pistachio"", I guess, but it smells like what it says on the tin. And faintly, like the tin itself. It is a light fragrance, but it really hangs in there for many, many hours. I've had several people sniff this and they have all come away looking perplexed. It could be my body chemistry adding the metallic note. Scents tend to pull soapy on me, but this is a new one. Idk. I get why this is a cult favorite.

Took a make up moisturizer cloth…one swipe and it was gone!! No smearing or retouches needed! Amazing!!!! I immediately ordered another one so I have one on hand when this one is used up! So happy with this product! I am a senior citizen, and those pricey brands for over 50 years old are worthless to me and my experience!

Amazon,Beauty_Personal_Care,beauty products,R2KN6D0T6YRWV3,Great Product - Not for Sensitive Eyes,"LOVE the look on the lashes this product gives. It 100% coats every lash and lengthens the entire look. It stays liquidy and easy to use until the product runs out. The style of wand really allows as heavy of a coat as you want to use. It is a bit harder to do a light coat with this wand, especially if using a pretty new bottle. It does not flake off during the day and leave scattered black flakes under eyes or face, which as you know, can be difficult to find in drug store products. The only downfall - it does seem to irritate the eyes more than other products. I wear contacts on a dialy basis. I never felt like my eyes were itchy or dry when using another brand. With this mascara, by the end of the day, my eyes feel itchy and dry and irritated. And heaven forbid you fall asleep without removing. The struggle is real.

The applicator allows the product to be spread evenly without clumping giving your lashes a nice, natural look. But compared to my Maybelline The Colossal Waterproof mascara, it doesn’t really give my lashes the “umph” I was hoping for. I think it’s mainly due to the color difference. The downside though with my Colossal mascara is that it smudges a lot and is a bit too waterproof, making it hard to take off even with micellar water. Because of this I’ll be using the Lash Sensational Sky High more but it is lacking a little also in my opinion.",4,Z. Hood,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2025"

This camera was super easy to set up and has all the features I need to check in on my pets when I am sat work or away from home. Picture quality is good and the field of vision adequate, and with the panning feature it is easy to look into different areas of a room. You can pan side to side at least 180 degrees as well as up and down to a certain degree. The camera plus into a wall outlet so there is no concern over battery life. I have another security camera that I use in another area of the house that is rechargeable which is great for an area that isn’t close to a power outlet but you always have to worry about battery life and recharging. No concern with this one. As with other security camera you can set up alerts for motion and it has other features. One feature I like is being able to use a SD card to store pictures and videos rather than use a cloud account although you still have that option for a price. Picture quality is good, the only issue I’ve experienced is when the camera is pointed to a window which makes the picture much darker trying to adjust to the bright light.

Amazon,Security_Surveillance,cctv,R3QN5X4DDU0UUG,Cat Cam with Great Features at an Unbeatable Price,"I was looking for a second cat camera to monitor our cats when we’re away from home, with specific needs: two-way audio, local and cloud recording, motion detection with alerts, and clear video with night vision. The TP-Link Tapo Pan/Tilt Security Camera, on sale for just $19, checked all my boxes and exceeded expectations with some unexpected bonuses. Here’s my experience to help you decide if this camera is right for you. Performance and Features The 1080P video is sharp and clear, providing enough detail to see what my cats are up to, even in low light thanks to the reliable night vision. The pan/tilt feature allows me to cover a wide area of the room, and the motion detection works flawlessly, sending alerts to my phone and triggering house lights when set up. The two-way audio is a fun bonus—I tested it and startled my cats by speaking through the camera when I wasn’t in the room! My wife loves that we can share video clips easily through the app, which adds a nice touch for capturing cute moments. Setup and Integration Setup was a breeze, and I was thrilled to find that the Tapo app automatically integrated with my existing Kasa app, adding the camera to my master device list without any extra effort. It works seamlessly with both Alexa and Google Home, allowing voice commands and linking motion alerts to control smart lights in the house. I inserted a 128GB Class 10 micro-SD card for local recording, which provides up to 16 days of continuous storage, and I also set up cloud recording for added peace of mind. Both recording options work perfectly for my needs. Verdict At $19, this camera is an absolute steal for a pet or baby monitor. It delivers clear video, reliable motion detection, two-way audio, and night vision, with the added flexibility of local and cloud storage. The seamless integration with the Kasa app, Alexa, and Google Home makes it incredibly user-friendly, and the ability to share clips is a fun perk. Whether you’re keeping an eye on pets, kids, or your home, this camera offers premium features at a budget-friendly price. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a versatile, high-quality security camera. Pro Tip: Pair it with a high-capacity micro-SD card (like a 128GB Class 10) for extended local recording, and take advantage of the Alexa/Google Home integration to link motion alerts with smart home devices for added convenience.

Amazon,Security_Surveillance,cctv,R2VPSC8IQA6UQK,Easy to install. 1080p is Amazing,"This product was a great deal! We got an excellent price on it, and it arrived early. It was well packaged and everything was secure with boxes and boxes of cameras, hard-drive and wiring. Install was super easy, since we were replacing our old system. Took my husband approx 1hr and 30 mins to get all the old cameras down (4) and new cameras (5/8) installed. We were able to use the old wires to pull new wiring through. Setup was also super easy, as we have not run this through our wifi. When we go through that process, I will try to update the review with information regarding setup and app installation. Picture quality is great day and night, but the night vision is fairly limited depending on light. The scope of details for the cameras are bright to dim where there is little to no light, covering an estimated 10'W by 30'D area. In well lit areas the distance is much greater with clear picture for up to 150' or more. That is the one negative and would be the one area needing improvement, or there may be another system that offers further coverage at night. The 2T hard-drive is big but not bulky. The system we replaced was only 1T and was about 4 in more narrow from front to back. We chose this system because of the ability to hook 8 cameras up. It also has the capabilities to mix and match so we can use wireless cameras if wanted as well. Since we were going from wired to wired, with the exception of one, we chose to keep the wired cameras instead of buying all new wireless. When we get the 3 wireless I will update the review with that info if able. Setting up the system was as easy as following the prompts. Password protected or not, it is up to you. We chose to go with a wireless mouse of our own rather than use the corded mouse that is included, and it works fine like that. Easy to configure cameras and set them up. The one area that we don't like is viewing options. You can set them up with all 8 on the screen but not just 5, so we have 3 black screens where those are not connected. 1 is displayed larger than the other 7, that are all smaller around 2 sides of the 1 larger. You can also display them 1 at a time that flips from 1 to the next, and if motion occurs it will jump back to the screen and hold there for designated time. There are other options as well if you decide to do the wifi and internet option- you can set alerts to shoot an email and even contact the monitoring app for remote viewing of every alert if necessary. The motion sensitivity can be set to certain areas in a grid or for entire screen and you can have it sensitive enough to alert when a leaf falls 20 yards away during the day or less sensitivity so that it doesn't trigger further than 5ft away. The whole program is really easy to maneuver and the possibilities are endless with this system. Hopefully this review helps. I definitely recommend this product if you want good quality, excellent picture and an easy install, all for a very competitive price.",5,Patricia,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2022"

I have the Eufy indoor camera / baby monitor, but left it at home while traveling. I purchased these as a cheap backup and honestly they work just as well for about 1/3 of the price! Such a great value! These aren't 4K HD or anything, but for what they are, the quality is pretty good! (I've attached pics of day and night so you can see for yourself.) The night vision lets you see pretty clearly even in super dark spaces. I have one in an interior closet with basically zero light, and somehow it still ""sees"" just fine. The night vision is in black and white rather than color, but I’m pretty sure that's true of all night vision cameras. The sound quality is also pretty good. It's far louder than you would expect, so it picks up noise very well. The motion detection feature is also nice. You can change the sensitivity so it doesn't pick up every little rustle in the room. You can also set it to differentiate between random movement and actual humans. I have one of the Tapo stationary cameras in my cat's LitterRobot (I know that's gross, please don't judge me. My cat had a urinary blockage and almost died so now I have to make sure he uses the box at normal intervals 🫣 ) and this helps differentiate if there's a cat in the box or it it's just the robot cycling. I guess that's not the most glowing review if the camera algorithm mixes up a cat and a human... but for my purposes, I appreciate it. Mountability: I don't have my cameras mounted, so I can't tell you how easy it is personally, but I did look into the mounts when I was deciding where I wanted to put them, and they look pretty fool-proof to set up.

How is this an outdoor camera as instructions say to not get plug wet etc and should be plugged in indoors, Disappointed that there are no bright flood lights like my other cameras from other brands less expensive, and it does not seem to have a color option and seems to be only black and white, the nite vision was ok and has a good distance however the alarm strobe light is useless imo as it is a tiny light that blinks, the alarm on high volume is too low, the adapter plug has a 10ft thin cord it has sd option like all the other cameras do and 2 way talk, it says, have not tested that yet, but cannot find a color option all cameras have this now so I do not see why this one doesn't, I am going to test it for the next 25 days and if it doesn't function well will return it I guess, but I wish they would be more clear about how it is called an outdoor camera yet instructions says not to get adapter wet, set up was not difficult, they all work the same, the Alexa app has it listed as Alexa compatible and I linked it to the app, but overall compared to one I bought that has dual cameras on one for only 16.00 I do t think it is better or worth the extra $ It doesn't detect things as I think it should we tested it multiple times, I put sensitivity up high .

Amazon,Security_Surveillance,cctv,R52M2JOS2YFYB,Loooove this camera!!!!!,"Amazing camera for peace of mind. I’m a dog trainer, and have a “dog room” in my garage, and this camera was a LIFE saver! I seriously have so much more peace of mind knowing even if I leave my home, I can still see what’s going on and have a track record of everything that has happened if need be to show clients proof. It also allows others to join, so my employee can join as well and update accordingly. It’s very motion sensitive which I WANT and picks up even when the dogs are just barking and I need to go in there to see what’s going on. Amazing tool for pet owners, care takers, buisness owners, and people who just want general security in their home & want to know what’s going on and have a record of such. Disclaimer** amazing for nanny cams, pet cams, and general monitoring but it does have a monthly subscription to be able to save videos, but it’s very low & absolutely worth it to me as someone who operates a business and likes a paper trail. All in all, have had no issues with connection (and mine is in my garage!!!) so far away from the router, no issues with the app, and I’ve been extremely satirized with all that it can do for the price!

Amazon,Security_Surveillance,security camera,R16SNR0C22B4UF,Great value for the price!,"These cameras are such a great deal! They are advertised as 2k resolution, but they are much lower. However this is fine, as the quality is still great for a security camera and the smaller size realistically means less data written to your microSD card if you are using local storage. I can still see everything with great detail. The pan and tilt features work great and it has motion tracking, although I personally leave them static and focused on a single location. It comes with a mounting bracket and you can invert the camera in the app, so you can mount it upside down if you want to attach it to a ceiling. I got these mainly for use at night. The built-in infrared lighting for night vision is powerful for such a small camera. It lights up everything in frame, although I am using them indoors, so the viewing distance is no more than 30ft in the biggest room of the house. Still, I see everything clearly. It also has the option to disable IR in case you prefer color, but this will come at a cost of less detail, as the sensor may not have enough light to light everything up. You can also select a mode to have it use night vision, but diable its own infrared light, incase you are using a separate external infrared light. I don't think you would need an additional infrared light unless you were planning to use this outside and over a larger distance. Overall, really happy with these cameras for the price. They definitely give more peace of mind and make the home feel more secure. If you are planning to get these, I'd recommend ordering some microSD cards and using local storage so that you dont have to pay for cloud service. Their cloud service plans for what they offer are pricey, and aren't worth it IMO, but to others they might be.",5,KC,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2025"

This camera FAR surpasses the “Blink” cameras. We use it every day and it has caused us almost no issues. Occasionally it’ll disconnect from the WiFi, but it usually reconnects quickly on its own (I’ve only had to climb up to reset it once!). The reliability alone makes it worth it. We loved it so much that we purchased a second one. It’s incredibly easy to install, and the ability to share the live view with family members is a huge plus. The app is very user-friendly, and there’s no subscription needed, which feels rare these days. Image quality is clear, the controls are intuitive, and overall it just works exactly the way you want a nursery camera to work. On top of that, the customer service is fantastic—they email you after your purchase to see if you need help, and they even check in occasionally just to make sure everything is still working well.

I especially like the live tracking feature where if the camera detects a human, it will attempt to track and follow that person around the room. At first, it seems very unreal and kind of creepy that a camera is following you, but I've gotten used to it and it's great so that you can review the footage later and follow the motion. The set up to my wireless network through the app was straight forward, very easy to connect on the first try and the connection has been strong ever since.

The solar panels seem to charge them very effectively, only needing to charge about every three days, and you can track that through the app very easily. These have pretty much every feature you could want in a home security camera. The one feature I wish they did have ( and could probably be added later through firmware update, hint hint Eufy) is the ability to have the cameras scan an area regularly. You can set a default position and multiple additional views in the app, but have to switch between them manually. It is great that I can view recorded clips and live footage from anywhere very easily and everything is stored locally at my home with no subscription.

Amazon,Security_Surveillance,security camera,R2VPMJCXPDLCJ2,Perfect Solar-Powered Camera for Simple Home Security,"This is the second security camera I've purchased, and it's a significant upgrade! My first experience was with a Blink camera, which was a decent entry-level option, but the monthly fees were a downside. What I immediately loved about this camera is that it doesn't require any monthly subscription. I've always been intrigued by 360 cameras but wasn't sure which one to choose. When this one popped up as a Black Friday deal, I jumped at the chance, and I'm so glad I did. The installation was straightforward, with easy-to-follow instructions. It connects to Wi-Fi effortlessly, making setup a breeze. I had it professionally mounted on the side of my house, and the image quality is excellent. The audio is also clear, making it a high-quality camera overall. The fact that there's no mandatory monthly fee is a huge plus, though there's an option to upgrade if desired. Video storage is handled locally on the camera. It's important to note that motion detection recordings, such as people approaching or cars stopping by, are automatically deleted after 24 hours. While you can purchase additional storage if you need to keep videos longer, I personally find the 24-hour storage sufficient for my needs. I'm comfortable with the videos disappearing unless there's a specific recording I want to save or download. For those seeking a simple, reliable camera to monitor their front door or home, I highly recommend this one. The solar panel feature is a game-changer. No need to worry about changing batteries or complicated wiring, as it charges itself continuously.",5,Maria G.,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2025"

Amazon,Security_Surveillance,security camera,R33Z7M9RD9YXTU,Pretty Good PTZ Solar Security Cameras,"These cameras are pretty good. Good clarity, good tracking, not too sensitive or lacking sensitivity. Picks up wildlife around my property when I have animal detection turned on. Human tracking is ideal. I do recommend following the installation instructions and mount the camera(s) so they detect at an angle. Head on monitoring doesn't always pick up a person approaching the house. Easy setup and if you need a larger amount of storage, purchase the Home Base. Battery life is good. The solar panels recharge the batteries well. The only downfall I have found is that when viewing Live View, there is an annoying pop-up every couple of minutes causing you to either keep live view going or cancel live viewing. I rely heavily on live view and I monitor my battery level so I don't need a pop-up that cancels the live view if you don't choose to continue it. I have sent a suggestion to the manufacturer explaining my issue. I think (I'm no pro at how this all works) it may just be a programming change in software (app). We'll see.

You cannot setup auto cloud storage and the device will delete old videos when it reaches capacity, but it has a solid built in storage capacity.

HP support has a video on their YouTube channel of how to set it up, and it was really straight forward. After you take off the tape and plastic liners, it has you download the HP app and the app guides you through setting up the WiFi, paper, & ink. Overall from unboxing to printing my first sheet, it probably took about 15-20 minutes. Setting up my WiFi and connecting to my phone was a breeze. I don’t have a computer so I was worried about finding a printer that could easily print from my phone, but this was very simple and easy to do. I was able to print documents directly from my files, as well as photos from my photo app. It takes a little less than 30 seconds per sheet, which isn’t bad for an at home printer, but could be slightly irritating if you’re printing over 50 pages at a time. The ink is great, prints pretty true to color. The black is saturated, and the colored ink is slightly less vibrant but that’s not an issue for me personally. I added a photo of what it looks like printing via the HP app, as well as the printed page afterwards. As you can see, the black is nice and saturated, the red is slightly less saturated but nothing bad, and it prints very accurately. This is perfect for my homeschooling needs, & for less than $40 I’m very happy with it. Pros : - printer and copy machine in one - comes with ink both black and colored - black ink is nice and saturated - an additional 3 month free trial to their ink subscription - after the trial the ink subscription isn’t very expensive either which is great. - 1 year warranty included - affordable printer (bought on sale for $35) - set up took less than 20 minutes start to finish - prints fast enough for at home use - can print straight from my phone, either from files or photo library Cons : - colored ink is slightly dull, but not too bad as long as you’re not printing actual photos. - the print speed could be an issue for you if you’re printing over 50 pages at a time",5,jay,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2025"
Amazon,Office_Printer_Supplies,printer,RY7Q1LAMDOVNP,"A great inexpensive little printer, scanner, copier all in one quiet compact unit","I purchased the HP Desktop Printer for home use, primarily for assistance when writing Amazon product reviews and it has proved invaluable for keeping my paperwork organized. After several weeks of use I’m satisfied with its performance. It works as expected and has greatly improved my daily routine. Setup took just minutes, the instructions were clear and everything connected immediately. No user manual was included but YouTube videos helped with any questions I had. It prints, scans and copies efficiently all in one quiet compact unit. Unlike other printers I’ve used in the past, I haven’t had a problem losing Wi-Fi connection and the print speed is extremely fast with the ability to print right from my computer, tablet or phone. I did read it only supports 2.4GHz WiFi networks so keep that in mind before you purchase. The ink supply that was included is holding up well even after extensive use and the cartridges were easy to install. Since I will primarily be printing in black and white I like the fact that I can print in single cartridge mode, which means I will only have to buy black ink cartridges. The print quality is not the best but acceptable for my purposes. The paper tray feels solid and doesn’t jam. I plan to download the HP Smart App soon. The product exceeded my expectations in terms of quality. It was well packaged, durable, the design both functional, space saving and attractive. At a price of just $38.89, this Amazon limited time deal offered exceptional value compared to similar products. It arrived in great condition and on time. Highly recommended.",5,Eva Huet,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2025"
Amazon,Office_Printer_Supplies,printer,R19SSRW1M9IDIN,Solid All-in-One Printer with Great Wireless Features,"I've been using the HP DeskJet 2827e for about two months now, and overall, I'm quite satisfied with this printer. The setup process was straightforward - I had it connected to my WiFi and printing from my phone within 15 minutes. The wireless printing capability is excellent. I can easily print from multiple devices including my laptop, tablet, and smartphone without any connection issues. The HP Smart app makes it simple to manage print jobs, check ink levels, and even scan documents directly to my phone. Print quality is solid for everyday documents and casual photo printing. Text comes out crisp and clear, and colors are reasonably accurate for home use. The scanner works well too, producing clean scans suitable for digital archiving and email attachments. However, there are a couple of drawbacks worth mentioning. First, the printing speed is somewhat slow compared to higher-end models - it's not a problem for occasional printing but could be frustrating if you're printing large documents regularly. Second, like most inkjet printers, the ink cartridges don't last as long as I'd hoped, especially if you print in color frequently. The HP Instant Ink subscription helps manage costs, but it's an additional ongoing expense. Despite these minor issues, this printer offers great value for home users who need basic printing, scanning, and copying capabilities with wireless convenience. It's compact, relatively quiet, and does exactly what most people need without breaking the bank.",4,andrew,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2025"
Amazon,Office_Printer_Supplies,printer,R2WM7BFC695TT6,HP DeskJet is wonderful!!!,"It was easy setup and installation. It came with instructions. Just need some computer knowledge to set it up. It works great! HP Instant Ink saves you money on ink cartridge, which came with the printer and setup. It prints well and it connects with wireless internet (Wi-Fi). I can't believe a great working HP Printer was only $53. No complaints! It works great, easy setup, and affordable price!! I love it!! Thanks, HP and Amazon!!!",5,Kathryn Sooyeon Jang,TRUE,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2025"
